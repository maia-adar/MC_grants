Manifesto/Vision: We want to build an NFT community focused on large-scale crypto-economic games on chain. All economic games have two outcomes: some participants can strategically win part of the treasury, or the treasury is diverted to a voted-upon directive aligned with the DAO’s growth. These games take the form of prisoner’s dilemmas, ultimatum games, or auction-style voting games. Product Value: Economic games are an entertaining way to place stakes on DAO growth and build long-term NFT communities. See our wiki here and our website: moralultimatum.xyz. Here is our deck. Validation: We are still building. Progress: We are still building. Differentiation: We are building out a technically differentiated system for economic games using NounsDAO inspired auction mechanics and validated social experiments from economic game theory. Team: Rishab Gargeya (expected B.S./M.S. in CS (concentration in crypto) from Stanford 2022), Sohan Vichare (expected B.S. in Math, M.S. in CS 2023 from Stanford) Grant Request $: $8,000 to support the creation and rollout of Saints and Sinners.

We are building liquidity pools that will set prices on ERC-1155/ERC-20 pairs. The ERC-1155 tokens in this case will be fractions of one underlying NFT that have been broken down on Fraktal.io’s marketplace. Fraktal.io has developed contracts that will allow NFT holders to break their ERC-721 or ERC-1155 NFT’s into up to 10,000 ERC-1155 tokens. Our new feature will allow these users to then exchange these ERC-1155 tokens and ETH for LP tokens and stake them to a liquidity pool, creating a pool that trades fractional shares of the underlying NFT with ETH. This product is a fairly big pivot from Yapeswap v1, which allocates idle liquidity in liquidity pools to single asset Yearn vaults to maximize capital efficiency on behalf of the LP. Manifesto/Vision
As written in the Yapeswap Documentation: ""Our Mission is to build novel AMM features that provide liquidity providers with opportunities to earn yield on their assets in the most capitally efficient ways possible. Our Vision is that our application will be governed by and for the members of the DAO and the users of the protocol, and that we can reach a point of runoff development, where the core team is no longer needed to make decisions and foster development. To achieve our Mission and Vision, we will work to ship new features as often as possible while fostering the growth of the DAO and community and finding opportunities for collaboration with other strong web3 teams and communities."" Problem Solution Product
How it will work once live Validation
Both the Raid Guild and the team at Fraktal.io believe we have a strong idea for a new product which will give us an opportunity at another, more sustained and successful launch than our first launch in August. Our small but active community on Discord is also excited about the new product. Progress
July - Core team formed
August - Yapeswap v1 Launch
September, October - Form relationships with protocols such as Fraktal.io, community building, in-house NFT project development.
November - Raid Guild hired to build pools, Yapeswap team is handling the UI updates, deployment of the new pools, and is relaunching the native token in order to provide adequate incentives for LP’s of the new NFT pools, to do away with our token trinity, and to migrate our DAO to DAOHaus.
December - Yapeswap v2 launch Differentiation
The idea of fractional NFTs being traded in pools with ETH is not new. However, protocols such as Fractional.art have only launched pools where the NFT fractions are traded as ERC-20 tokens. We think building ERC-1155 and developing the market for these types of pools can continue to lead to new interesting ways we can help our users earn yield on their assets. Below are a few reasons why we are excited about building with the ERC-1155 standard. We feel our team and formation story is a point of differentiation for us as well. Our team started as exclusively part time anons, and none of the current team members had any web3 employment experience to speak of when we first banded together. Yapeswap is as much an expiriment in DAOing and community building as it is an experiment in building novel AMM features. Team
As stated above, Yapeswap v1 was shipped by a team of anons who banded together in the name of capital efficiency. The team members who remain dedicated are listed below. Most of the team are relatively new to building in web3 and come from a web2 background (or another field entirely). Torg (Full-time) - Operations, BizDev, Community Management

Crypnotiq - Fraktal.io lead, has helped shape the vision for Yapeswap v2 Grant Request $
$10,000 DAI Funds
The Yapeswap DAO has voted to to hire the Raid Guild for $16,000 DAI, and the funds have already been processed. Work is scheduled to start on 11/15. We are requesting $10,000 in DAI to partially cover these costs. Help
We invite anyone who is interested in the project to join our discord server and take a look at our DAO Forum, any feedback that we receive will be taken into consideration.

2,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/gig-protocol-grant-proposal/1628,Gig Protocol Grant Proposal - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,jacobean," Hi everyone, thank you for the opportunity to speak about the Gig Protocol. An EVM compatible protocol for the gig economy. The centralized corps that define the gig economy are at odds with their own communities — both their workforce and their clientele. Uber and Lyft employees seem to be perpetually on strike against low pay and bad working conditions. Airbnb and contracting services like Fiverr take very large fees that force users to transact off-platform. What’s clear is that the honeymoon phase of the gig economy is over and as reality sets in the relationship between platform and user is becoming increasingly forced , stale , and ripe for disruption . Although there is plenty of griping within the current gig system, it is still a growing and widely used industry. To challenge its supremacy we must reinvent the primitives — the foundational elements on which it was built. At its most fundamental, the gig economy is a series of escrow contracts for services rendered. If driver A delivers passenger to designation B then pay out driver. A decade ago, when the gig economy began, this was quite a challenging task involving the coordination of payment processors and secure backend applications. But, with the advent of Web3 , where payment processing and security are inherent to the stack, we can much more elegantly build out the necessary components for escrow services. This gives us an opportunity to reframe the fundamentals of the gig economy with a focus on composability. Rather than build in a single vertical, such as ride share or rentals, we are constructing an escrow primitive . It will become our base unit, on top of which we can both rebuild existing gig verticals as well as open the door for new creations previously, unimaginable in the world of Web2 . To understand the needs of our market and iterate on our underlying service, we’ve chosen to begin by applying our escrow protocol to a single vertical we are calling Good Morning. Good Morning is focused on building an elegant UX for contract jobs paid out in crypto. Kleros has some great code for Escrow but we believe they lack the UX and multi-chain support to make it as useful as it could be. Our initial focus will be to build a fork of Kleros supported on low tx chains like xdai and Polygon with a super clean UI. Here is an image of one of our UI views we are working on.

As you can currently see in current events, the Supply Chain is facing disruption due to no empty containers, too much freight, no warehousing, and little to no drivers. To address the overall antiquated views of logistics, we’d like to make sure companies and drivers are paid on time with freight transparency. Manifesto/Vision & Description
Truckin’ Coins is resolving supply chain visibility in payment, safety, and invoicing issues with cutting-edge technology, on a play-to-earn platform. Our target audience for our game/app would be Truck Drivers, Owner Operators, and Trucking Companies. Solution On the front-end, drivers and users are seeing our gaming platform. The goal is to get the gaming platform to where there is real-time navigation done and no interaction required from drivers, while also reporting their miles, activities, and safety features for coins. Our $TRUX/TRUK coins would be redeemable for useful items like gas discounts, oil changes, showers, food, etc. On the back-end, we’d like to complete instant smart contracts, invoices, and payments through a platform like ProDoge. By utilizing developers for these integrations, we’d be able to resolve slow to no pay for truck drivers, while also addressing the Logistics factoring industry. We’d also like to use what we’ve built to track and trace freight for companies using our Blockchain technology. Product We’ve developed an Alpha version of our play-to-earn game playable on iOS for people to interact with: Truckin’ Coins TestFlight iOS You can also see our test version on YouTube: Truckin’ Coins Test Run We plan on connecting our ERC-20 coins in partnership with the ProDoge app/platform: https://prodoge.com/ Validation
We already have soft commitments from Ocean Freight, Air Freight, and Trucking companies to validate our research. We’re existing participants in accelerators in the Midwest, inclusive to one at St. Louis University. Progress
We’ve developed the iOS version of our game and released an Alpha version in TestFlight
We’re working on the Android TestFlight version
We currently have pre-mined $1M ERC-20 $TRUX coins on our Blockchain in consideration for an Airdrop for early adopters and users of our platform. Funds Grant Request $10,000 (Since the beginning of our development, a company has incorporated TRUX, so we plan on forking to TRUK coin) Our purpose for raising funds would be for: UI/UX
Development - Mobile, Front/Back/FullStack, Blockchain
DevOps/Cybersecurity - PenTesting/Bug Bounty
Marketing - AirDrop Promotion, App Marketing, etc.
Business Development / Partnership Our current needs to address would be marketing our game/creating an AirDrop, integrating our Blockchain to our existing mobile game, forking & mining our existing coin, and integration of ProDoge. Differentiation Companies like UberFreight, Convoy, and Amazon Relay are running load boards with rewards, but aren’t making the Logistics space interactive or making more people want to join. Currently, there are platforms using smart contracts and blockchains separately on other platforms. There are other TMS systems available, but we’re hoping to group all the enhancements in one enjoyable app and location. We’re focused on the service providers and their wellness, but also able to utilize new technologies in an antiquated industry. We’re less focused on being a load board and more on providing an immersive breath of fresh air for truckers. Drivers would be able to add to the ecosystem by mining & incurring coins with mileage, daily active use, and other activities. We aim to reward truckers that utilize our Blockchain-based mobile gaming platform during their shift.  The goal is for drivers to handle payments, logging, documentation, and safety reporting through our platform.

Path to Oblivion1638×2048 355 KB
     Proof of stake chains allow for tokenized engagement. It essentially works by staking tokens in a protocol that distributes yield for engaging with content — with the content creator themselves being rewarded from that yield.
This is a more positive-sum tokenomics. Rather than a conventional payment where one user gains a token and another loses, new tokens are distributed to a user for providing another user value. This allows for some interesting applications to MetaCartel. Namely, as added functionality + funding for grants and as a social utility for Chili tokens. My proposal is to get this deployed and in full beta testing for the DAO in a month.   I will create a social testing token that runs on a protocol for tokenized engagement. This will be airdropped to the community, where it will interface seamlessly with discord. The engagement being tokenized in this case is an emoji reaction. If a user receives certain emoji reactions on their post — a signifier that their post has provided some value to the community — then the poster will receive tokens. The goals for this proposal are as follows: R&D for ETH2. I believe tokenized engagement is the future of web3 social. Where Steem and EOS have previously failed to deliver, I think Ethereum will succeed. A part of this is timing, but a lot is Etherean culture. Many people in the web3 community view tokenized engagement as a failed concept. I want to prove that it’s not the concept that has failed, but rather the communities it’s been deployed to. I think MetaCartel is the perfect place to test how this can actually work well. ETH2 ships in Q1 2022. That gives us time to see how this works before deciding how this could be ported to Ethereum and merged with MC tokens/Chili. Community Engagement. The content that users provide within this community has intrinsic value, be it educational or purely entertainment. If this token were a part of the community, it would encourage more participation and largely reward those that give outsized value to the community. It may also provide an alternative pathway to membership. If a community member earns enough of this token from being a continued asset to the community, that could be exchanged for a DAO token. Grant Funding. A network empowered with tokenized engagement has the ability to generate positive-sum funding for a proposal just by voting on it. No payments necessary. I think this is worth experimenting on.   Create a MetaCartel token that runs on a protocol like the one described
Due to the small scope of this proposal, I will not be building out a protocol from scratch. I’ll make a token on top of Hive to test on. If this works well it should be ported to ETH2, which will allow for greater customization. Allow users to onboard and interface with the token within Discord
The interface will be a discord bot and the UX should be as seamless and secure as possible   I will try my best to get to these, but make no promises MetaCartel Forum Functionality
Allowing the MetaCartel forum to interface with the token could go one of three ways: browser extension, web crawler, and possibly(?) DiscoBot (the forum’s bot). ETH1 Proof of Concept
Could this work well on ETH1 using rollups and a reworked DeFi protocol?   $2,500 DAI | 1 month to ship","[(<p>Had a good chat with <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/autocrat"">@Autocrat</a> and I’m going to invite him to come speak at next weeks town-hall about this idea applied to the grants funnel.</p>, 'Yalor')]",2021-10-27T22:45:35Z

6,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/proposal-decentralized-block-explorer/862,Proposal: Decentralized Block Explorer - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,topocount," I’m working with Rick Dudley to build a decentralized block explorer that relies on IPLD-addressed content. This has some significant implications beyond just the block explorer itself. The block explorer itself will ultimately become a public good (which we can each host a node for if we want) but it actually provides some initial utility beyond just being a relatively simple block explorer (at first). Here’s an initial, rough look at the general architecture. A proper spec will be forthcoming within a few days. An Extensible Explorer that can grow with community Demands
Currently, the UI will be a relatively simple fork of the EthVM frontend, with the addition of a rudimentary internal transaction view. The reason this is starting out relatively simply is that we’re prioritizing standing up a full stack implementation to start troubleshooting and battle-testing the backend components for use in production since that’s the biggest potential bottleneck for mainnet. However, we want to make this extensible and pluggable so it can modularly support new features (like contract verification and community-sourced labelling systems) that get progressively merged into core as they evolve if the community decides they should be. Ultimate Vision: A Sustainable Ecosystem for Dapp Frontends and Underlying Data The backend for the explorer is specc’d to be much more complex than it minimally needs to be for good reason. We’re working to lay the ground work for a P2P CDN, in a sense. Data availability for web3 is still in a very nascent stage. Many projects currently follow a more web2-like funding model where you pay subscriptions up front to access tiers of data they’re sourcing or features they offer (see infura, blocknative), or worse, users are the product (see etherscan). The ultimate vision beyond the explorer itself is infrastructure that instantly flows value in return for requested data. Anyone with hardware and an internet can supply and/or relay the data. Even end users should be able to recoup some of their consumption costs via a P2P connection to the network. This data could be a web frontend or it could be live ethereum state, which can be transformed (aka mapped) to be human-readable and consumable by a frontend, or any other potentially valuable piece of information. This system provides the foundation for sustainable funding models for frontends as well. By building a pay-as-you-go system that encourages the egalitarian distribution of data through an auctioning network using layer 2 technology (currently state channels), frontends and data availability can be sustainably incentivized and maintained. The Watcher nodes in the diagram above will be bundled as a dappnode package, which can be configured to host/relay configured data. The backbone of all this is IPLD-addressable content. this structure is already widely adopted, and supports ethereum data natively, and VulcanizeDB which acts as both a Geth node and an accessible store of decoded Eth state, blocks, and transcations. What’s needed from MetaCartel Since this project is meant as a public good, we’re trying to bootstrap it as such. A development grant for a minimally-viable block explorer on the stack laid out (likely sans the payment infrastructure) above has already been procured. What’s needed from MetaCartel at this point is a community of contributors who want to work with me to build the project and perhaps more importantly, sustain this project in the long term beyond this initial work. The immediate work is clearly very important, and, as I already have fulltime obligations as a core dev as SourceCred, I’ll need some help managing this project and will need developers to help me implement this vision. First right of refusal for these roles goes to Raid Guild members. Roles to Fill (Quantities depend on availability): Beyond this Raid, I can’t champion this by myself, as much as I would love to. The combination of complexity and a lack of hours in the day makes it impossible for me, and want to submit this for adoption at the doorstep of this community at least for now. Efforts I’ll be taking up in short-mid term, that I will need the community’s help on:",[],2020-12-01T19:18:15Z

LOCATION: McNichols Civic Center Building (Denver, CO)
ADDRESS: 144 W Colfax Ave, Denver, CO 80202
DATE & TIME: October 1st, 2021 (6PM - 9PM MST) OUR VISION: We empower the culture with resources & education through strategic development that propel us in the social, economical, business and political realms. Our mission is to inspire those we encounter. We create strategies for marginalized communities to become self-determined. End Game Association’s (EGA) vision and reach expands far beyond the competitive chess board. After the success of our prior chess tournaments, EGA has continued to position themselves alongside creative visionaries, committed community liaisons and resource-rich stakeholders. EGA is not only about seizing the opportunity to empower our communities financially from NFT’s & Crypto, but to also acquire and disseminate knowledge and training around the subjects at our chess tournaments in physical spaces to further nurture the intimate bond that makes us a local community. STATEMENT OF INTENT: End Game Association will facilitate one monthly project for 3 months to bring more artists into the DeFi community to explore innovative collaborations between physical artists and blockchain technology. We would like to host our 5th chess tournament at McNichols Civic Center Building, located in Denver, CO. Through strategic community gatherings, we organize artists, activists, creatives, civic minded people, educators & entrepreneurs with various experiences to navigate through life with strategy. We provide programs that include: art, chess, financial literacy, youth mentoring & access to resources for those in need. We aspire to influence leaders that are driven to make a difference. EGA is truly helping to establish themselves by becoming part of Denver’s rapidly emerging/evolving fin-tech ecosystem. We are inviting 16 artists in which we would be minting NFTs of custom chess boards that are ready to be minted. There are currently 6 boards ready to be minted. The artists will also create a canvas piece live at the event, and those pieces would also be minted on the blockchain. The games of the chess tournament will be captured live on video & photo and could also be minted on the blockchain. We would also like to invite more artists to customize & submit their custom chess boards so that we could mint them & also pay them for their production time & artistry. ABOUT THE PROJECT: The CyberPanther Party is a generative art NFT project with a focus on activism built using ERC721 and governed through DAO code. There are a total of 10,000 Panthers that are randomly generated using a verified script. Although there are different levels of rarity, all the NFTs allow the members to become members of the party. With so much representation of the cyberpunks movement, we felt like civil rights and human rights movements are not being represented in our crypto communities. These historic movements need to be represented and honored on the blockchain. After all, we all need our rights to be honored. Activism is usually targeted by big corporations and corrupt people that want to oppress others. This is a main reason why making our party on the blockchain using DAO methods is a revolutionary way to make sure our voices will never be silenced or censored. This project is created to bring and highlight the struggle for civil and human rights for people of color and all of those who are oppressed. Members of the party have a lot of benefits. Those include, but are not limited to, 1 vote per wallet for DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), access to the Activist Bail Fund, Scholarships, Grants, Exclusive Merch, as well as access to the Chapter (an art canvas that members can draw on). Add on, the NFT will act as an admission ticket to real life physical events as well as virtual ones. 50% of the original sales from the NFT will be locked for the Panthers Fund in a publicly disclosed wallet address, which is the pool of liquidity for the perks mentioned above.

The global information services market, which is projected to grow to 842 million ETH (or $196.7 billion) by 2025, is driven by subject-matter experts. Their knowledge of complex information environments is necessary to navigate through information chaos. Despite the importance of their expertise, subject-matter experts are often employed in precarious, underpaid labor. Some are consultants, who spend more time drumming up business than performing research and analysis. Others work at firms where creativity is discouraged and much of the value they create is captured by salespeople (who distribute their insights), product and engineering (who build their tools and structure their insights as data), and investors (who fund them). Enable subject-matter experts to focus on what they do best (generating insights) by building tools and processes to accelerate their workflows and connect them with collaborators, customers, and investors.‌ The Diamond ecosystem will have three components: (i) content development platform, (ii) content distribution platform, (iii) content request platform. The content development platform will enable Diamond members to collaboratively build and update datasets based on qualitative research. Users will be able to define a dataset (a topic, requested attributes, etc), and add rows of qualifying data to the dataset. Users will also be able to update existing records for quality assurance. The content distribution platform will enable users to advertise datasets, and publish feeds of insights (i.e. article, report) related to their datasets and areas of expertise. The content request platform will enable users to request custom feeds of insights based on user-selected parameters. Diamond’s POC market will be DAO governance data (the initiative will be named Polis). Several Diamond members are deeply engaged with DAOs, including DXdao, and see an opportunity to provide insights and datasets on DAO governance, covering decentralized, barriers to participation in governance, and engagement, that are differentiated from other market offerings (including Deep DAO, which recently raised a $3 million seed round). Diamond’s primary validation has been through recruitment and user interviews. @amphiboly has conducted user interviews with members of several active DAOs, including DXdao, who have expressed interest in purchasing access to insights related to DAO governance metrics and best practices. One has become a member and contributed funds to Diamond. @amphiboly also recruited the founder a firm that is interested in collaborating with Diamond to develop and market insights on topics relevant to their firm, and also contributed funds to help Diamond realize its vision. Onboarded 7 members, who are bootstrapping Diamond with $18,000 in funds Conducted user interviews with potential customers / partners relevant to Polis Built and began executing on roadmap for Polis MVP Writing user stories for content development, distribution, and request platforms in preparation for consultation with Raid Guild Key Diamond contributors have experience designing, developing, and distributing complex data products and pipelines and for F100 companies as founders, senior product professionals, intelligence analysts, and data engineers. This experience provides us a unique perspective on how to identify market gaps, design and build differentiated data products to fill those gaps, and assure the quality of our data and analysis. We want to use that expertise to design systems and tools that enable decentralized teams to collaborate and build data products and insights without undue rent extraction from engineers and sales professionals.

Each NFT can improve attributes and rewards through integration and exploration. All of this runs on Ethereum’s smart contract. Manifesto/Vision： · It is open to everyone, everyone has the opportunity to free mint · Each NFT is special, and the rarity is determined by the owner ·Give each participant economic income Problem： At present, most NFTs are collections or breeding. This allows most people to participate in only holding or buying and selling, which is not cool Why can’t uniqueness and growth coexist? Solution： We make the value manifest from another angle through the gameplay of fighting NFTs with higher rankings can continue to receive rewards, and any participant can also get value from them Owners use various methods to make their NFTs more rare, and it is entirely up to them. Product： Treasuresea is an NFT protocol completely built on the Ethereum network The main functions include: Mint: In addition to paying for Gas, Mint does not require any fees. A total of 10,000 Treasuresea in the first phase challenge: When the user has one or more NFTs, the user can challenge other NFTs. It can be based on the opponent’s ranking or the opponent’s number. When the challenge is successful, you can get the ranking of the winning side and other rewards. Ranking: Ranking is the basis of the reward mechanism. Within one month of the project’s launch, the team will develop a complete economic model to motivate all NFT participants. The highest-ranked people will receive a percentage of copyright income explore: Exploring can improve your NFT attributes, which is also conducive to competing for higher rankings Of course, it is full of randomness Validation： Our Github:https://github.com/Treasureseas/treasureseas-protocol Progress： We have completed the casting and revision of the value, and are currently constructing the random generation and exploration part. It is expected that the first version can be deployed on the Ethereum test network soon. Differentiation： Opening up more power to the owners is what we have been committed to, so that everyone can create economic value and continue to gain the fun of growth is our focus Team： Treasuresea was founded by Pavle Cooper, who has worked in the blockchain industry for more than five years and has experience in media, business, and marketing. And focusing on decentralized applications, it is one of the earliest players of CryptoKitties. Currently the team includes two engineers and a marketing staff. Grant Request $： $8,000 (most of which is used to deploy smart contracts on Ethereum) Funds： ETH、DAI、USDT Help： We hope to get help from the community in the early promotion Additional Resources： After the project goes live, I hope to give away some Treasures to the metacartel community to thank for the donation",[],2021-10-08T23:27:29Z
10,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/proposal-animal-creator-token/973,Proposal: $ANIMAL Creator Token - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,jdshutt," $ANIMAL (https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xc787dad394ae566dee96575a676afdf3c0c7a88f) is an experimental creator token for visual artist Oleg Kolbasov, aka Animal Money. (https://animal.money) The idea here is that an artist can issue their own ERC20 token, seed a liquidity pool, and accept their own token as payment for unique NFTs. This makes the token price a reflection of market demand for the artists’ NFTs and speculation on the future demand for their NFTs. It’s a minimum viable system for creating an independent fan economy. All you need is an ERC20 token, an ERC721 contract, an AMM pool, and artistic talent. The original concept was that we would issue an $ANIMAL token on Uniswap, and whoever accumulated 50% of the supply would be able to win an NFT and physical painting that was being painted live on Twitch. This would be an interesting real-time auction of a painting while it is being created, with the addition of a secondary market for the $ANIMAL token that could create interesting trading behavior and a lot of fan interaction. What we learned is that Uniswap v2 price slippage makes it impractical to accumulate 50% of the token supply. Gas fees were also prohibitive, especially given the low initial token price (~$1 per $ANIMAL), which made token purchases feel slightly ridiculous, since the gas cost was much higher than the token cost. The price of $ANIMAL ultimately quadrupled, but there would need to be many more trades against the pool to bring it up to a reasonable price, and lots of gas burned on the way. However, setting up the ERC20 token and Uniswap pool was very simple. We began to think about different ways to create an ongoing revenue stream for creators through the same mechanism, and decided that this flow should be repeatable: We’re pretty sure this would work, and would give the creator full control over their internal fan economy without any protocol or marketplace dependencies. We want to deploy an ERC721 contract for minting NFTs of Animal Money’s artwork, which will be listed for sale priced in $ANIMAL tokens. We also want to migrate most of $ANIMAL’s liquidity from Uniswap v2 to Uniswap v3 when possible. Being able to specify a price range as an LP instead of supplying liquidity from 0 to ∞ should fix the price slippage issue we ran into during the hackathon, and we can set a more realistic base price. We also want to make NFT token minting and ERC20 token trading possible on Layer 2, to reduce gas fees. Finally, we want to explore NFT marketplaces that allow payment for NFTs with any ERC20 token, which would allow us to price our NFTs in $ANIMAL. Until we find a suitable venue, the $ANIMAL-to-NFT redemption will be a manual process where you have to contact the artist directly. That’s cool if there’s also a physical piece of art tied to the NFT, since you need to work out shipping, but if it’s a pure NFT minting action, it would be better if you could do it automatically. We were excited to get the message encouraging us to apply for a grant, since we have all of these ideas that are ready to go! What we really need is money for gas, paint, and canvas. The implementation itself is fairly straightforward. Any tips on marketing or emerging marketplaces that would let us price NFTs in our creator token would also be great, or if there are any holes in our proposed implementation above that we haven’t considered. Pretty sure 3 ETH would get us to where we need to be. This would be mostly spent on gas and providing liquidity, with a bit cashed out to offset material costs for painting. (Canvas is expensive!) The immediate step would be to deploy the ERC721 contract and complete our first direct NFT sale for $ANIMAL, and the other steps will need to wait a little bit for Uniswap v3 deployment.","[(<p><strong>Update (5/4/2021)</strong></p>, 'jdshutt'), (<p><strong>Update 5/5/2021</strong></p>, 'jdshutt'), (<p>How is this going any updates?

Title:
WeInvest Description:
An on-chain, community governed, trading platform, for stocks and crypto Manifesto/Vision:
About 30 years ago we had to place trades through a registered broker. We weren’t allowed to place our own trades. About a decade later, it was possible to place trades on your own, for around $10 in commission. Many years later, the commissions dropped to $0. What’s next? Soon it you will be paid to trade. And that’s what we’ve done. Problem
Trading platforms are centrally governed. The people contributing to the growth of the platform, is the users. They are not compensated appropriately. We pay them, by offering them a service. We pay them back, by creating the features they want and need. Most of the money we make from them, goes into the pockets of the early investors and founders. Solution
Create a platform that is community owned and governed. Allow the people using the platform, to submit proposals and vote accordingly. Product

12,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/proposal-randchain-a-community-driven-decentralised-randomness-beacon/1304,[Proposal] RandChain - a community-driven Decentralised Randomness Beacon - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,elvisage," Hello MetaCartel community, We would like to pitch our project. Please see the details below, and let us know if you have any comments. RandChain: a community-driven Decentralised Randomness Beacon In this project, we design and implement RandChain, a decentralised randomness beacon (DRB) that is community-driven. Unlike existing DRBs, RandChain is governed by a DAO rather than rich entities, is secured by Cryptography rather than marketing, and is sustainable by Tokenomics rather than continuous fundings. Randomness is a critical component of blockchains and the entire Internet, and DRBs are the major source of randomness. We believe that, to secure the randomness, DRBs should be controlled by a large group of ordinary people with constraint devices, rather than a small group of rich entities with industry-level hardware. Thus, we are motivated to DAOise the DRBs, bringing the ownership of randomness back to the blockchain community. Existing DRBs suffer from three limitations, making them not suitable for blockchain protocols and smart contract applications. Existing DRBs are centralised: they are usually governed by a small group of large entities. Existing DRBs require users to trust them, as the entities have incentive to collude and manipulate the random outputs for their advantage. Existing DRBs are not sustainable, as nodes in DRBs contribute to the randomness without receiving any reward. We attribute the limitations to the fact that, existing DRBs are not scalable enough to be operated by the community. We propose RandChain, a DRB that is community-driven. Apart from security properties common in DRBs, the RandChain protocol is the first DRB that satisfies both scalability (i.e., the DRB works normally even when a large number of nodes participate) and fairness (i.e., every node controls comparable voting power on the randomness). These two properties allow RandChain to be operated by a large-scale DAO. To make the DAO sustainable, RandChain will issue its own token $RAND supporting two business models, namely: Earn-as-you-work: If a node mines a random output, then it is rewarded with some $RAND tokens. Pay-as-you-use: Users (e.g., smart contracts) need to pay for a small amount of $RAND to access a random output. Node implementing the RandChain protocol Blockchain explorer Smart contract of the RandChain coordinator (aka oracle) Smart contract of the RandChain DAO Smart contract of the $RAND token We have a research paper detailing the design and analysis of the RandChain protocol as well as an academic prototype. The production-level RandChain node and RandChain explorer are under active development. This grant application is motivated by the need of accelerating the development and launch. RandChain is the first DRB that achieves scalability and fairness simultaneously, and thus the first DRB that can support a large-scale DAO. We are the first team that applies DAO and Tokenomics to DRBs. The team includes researchers with proven track records in blockchain and crypto research. Runchao Han is a PhD student at Monash University working on Blockchain scalability, advised by Jiangshan. He has published technical reports on leading blockchain-related conferences, including ISPASS, AFT and AsiaCCS. He has served as reviewer for various research conferences such as DSN ('20 '21), ICDCS’20, SRDS’20, and AFT’20. Jiangshan Yu is ARC DECRA Fellow, Associate Professor, and Associate Director (Research) at Monash Blockchain Technology Centre, Monash University, and has been an active researcher in the Blockchain area. He received IBM Academic Award (2020) for his work on blockchain and has served as a program committee member for leading blockchain-related international conferences, including DSN’21, ICDCS (‘20,‘21), ICBC (20’, 21’), FC’21, AFT’20, SRDS ('19,'20). $5,000 to support the RandChain development, possibly by getting a new developer on board. We haven’t received any fund yet. Initially RandChain starts as a research project. We will be more than happy if any community member is interested in offering help and/or providing comments to the RandChain project. The Github profile is here.

13,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/lets-join-poolworks/1292,Let's Join PoolWORKs - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,Yalor," A DAO of LP’s to pool and earn rewards together  Description: As the MetaCartel Ecosystem grows, new and more powerful projects will show up and allow for the best ideas to rain supreme. For MetaCartel to continue acting as a center of the ecosystem it must grow its influence in the space. One of the best ways in doing this is helping to lift up the projects that align with our aligned with our values. Aligning the MetaCartel with Opolis, by joining in the Liquidity DAO aka: PoolWORKs, allows MetaCartel to stay in support of the community it has helped develop and reap yields for a more sustainable future. Manifesto/Vision: By joining in this liquidity experiment we are signaling our support of the DAO and we are also partnering with an existing ecosystem project that many of our members are already utilizing. We stand to earn upwards of 70% APY if the DAO accomplishes its goals. By participating in this DAO we are helping to develop the ecosystem for decentralized employment. Problem: WORK token has no liquidity  Solution: a DAO for WORK LP’s to pool and earn rewards together . The more liquidity = greater price stability = better future prospects of decentralized work. Product: The result will be a successful WORK token. As the WORK token is one of the few tokens that can gauge the price of a decentralized economy, it’s price reflects the success. Validation: Currently many teams and member of MetaCartel have already committed funds to the PoolWORKs DAO to help provide liquidity for the V1 token launch. Progress: The DAO has launched. At least 7 teams have already committed funds (with 8 others finishing up proposals). LP Pool is set to launch on 9/12. Differentiation: By building off the PoolHAUS model, we are launching liquidity as a unified DAO. Rather than 1 party launching first, and others following suit after (opening them up to the risk of price fluctuation) this allows us all parties to enter at the same price. Team: Mystic Whales

I’ve been a avid crypto person since 2010. I’ve helped build payment processors, ASICs, Mining pools, Validator nodes you name it I have had my hands in it. This last year I’ve seen the DEFI space just pooling with so many people using these reflection tokens but they have no utility and its only basing on volumes. They all eventually die the “developers” pull liquidity and thats a wrap. Not very many winners and the ones losing are the ones leaving crypto behind them. During my time in the backgrounds of centralized exchanges the one in particular I worked at was selling Bitcoin hashing power on the live trading markets. Making hand over fist on both their hashing farm & the trading fees being associated with it. An then you have exchanges and so called ‘savings accounts’ for crypto where obviously they’re utilizing that crypto paying out pennies in their %APR to make hand over fist on your money. This is honestly no different then what banks are doing now. What I have been working on is already building a community and developing an AMM swap/farm that isn’t lucrative. The plan is setting up various nodes for proof of stake coins and just giving the guys who don’t care or never knew they could delegate tokens and mine them. Following it the incentive is this tax token is required to enter in it. Which will provide the utility needed. The proof of stake coins will also provide the continued liquidity to maintain the farm. Thats the problems I am seeing currently in this defi/token realm an I’ve yet to see one being utilized to go towards a DAO vault. The idea would be the 4 people I work with and already picked 4 volunteer community members to lock the vault. An we give the entire people inside the DAO the ability to vote on where we will invest the locker etc. Then profits made are split and divided into its token holders. Now of course pugging the effort & time. We want to get paid as well an I figured a % would be agreed upon if successful on each interset payout to be divided between the team. A % to the token holders and a % to go back into vault. Down the road start educating users about proof of work coins build a private mining pool and see if we can get a large enough amount of people to GPU mine some coins. Everything that is accruing some kind of profit will be in a gnosis safe. Just to help keep the trust within the trustless enviroment. So far I have completed the AMM swap accumulated roughly 300 active members an have not even started any sort of marketing campaign of the sorts. The team consists of 4 people 1 is a graphics designer the other is a front end web developer. The next guy is the one who should of wrote this up an does our content writing and marketing. An then myself who handles the development side of things. Getting a grant of $7500 would be more then enough to open up the DAO platform, pay for a presale launch at dxsale.app a third party audit of this tax token. An potentially the setup of validator node & its initial costs. This is a just the draft of what i’m really envisioning here as the whole idea. I’m pretty confident that this would take off given my extensive knowledge in various types of cryptocurrency investments and their capabilities… Looking forward to some replies on the idea and if it is something viable even without a little bit of a grant boost I am already to heavily invested in and will try proceeding regardless of outcome.

Irrational market behaviour triggers boom and bust cycles that can have damaging economic consequences to households and businesses. Furthermore, in the era of social media the risk of financial market  gamification has increased; assets can be pumped and dumped from just a single tweet or message board posting. Eczodex believes self-pricing financial instruments are a solution to irrational market behaviour. Our entry offering targets the cryptocurrency markets with a stablecoin statistically proven to combine intrinsic capital growth with low volatility. A back test against our prototype pricing algorithm, spanning 20 years, revealed that over 99% of daily price swings fell within the range of 0-1% and generated an average annual yield of 6.6%. Problem Our project is looking to address the following problems: Bipolar investment selection - Investors can choose to invest either in volatile
coins that bear the risk of exiting at loss; or stablecoins not yielding any intrinsic interest. Asset pricing driven by noise  - Social media has increased the risk of financial market  gamification; assets can be pumped and dumped from just a  single tweet or message board posting. CBDCs threaten stablecoins - Central bank plans to launch stablecoins creates an
existential threat to fiat-pegging stablecoins Solution Building on the initial success of dynamic pegged coins such as RAI and Float, Eczodex aims to further innovate in this space, providing price stability with a free floating asset. Our prototype coin, modelled on US fundamental data, draws on the quarterly balance sheets of public listed companies to set its pricing peg. The result is a coin with 2000 price updates per year, is free floating against the dollar, and does not require a fixed peg to maintain stability. Instead, price stability is achieved simply by virtue of the weighted average book values of the companies that make up the composition, which gets regularly updated to reflect the top performing 500 companies by public market cap. Our back test generated a 6.6% annual yield. Use cases: A stablecoin that will add excellent value to lending protocols such as Compound and Balancer, with the potential to outperform current stablecoin yields offered on their platforms. An ideal investment asset for DeFi Insurance protocols that have to invest $500mn + in stable, risk-averse products Attractive investment asset to onboard institutional investors Alternative to negative or low yielding bank accounts, encouraging further adoption of DeFi products and services. Validation To date we have developed the protocol design and prototype pricing algorithm. We have initially received very promising and positive feedback within the Cambridge University ecosystem, encouraging us to design and develop an initial prototype on Ethereum’s testnet. Now we want to take the next step and further validate our proposition within the DeFi community. Team We are a team of 3 Cambridge students: Michael - Masters student with a background in financial services. Decades of experience working for leading bancassurance organisations. Lukas - Masters student with a background in finance, law and data analytics. Work experience at Credit Suisse, McKinsey, and Latham & Watkins. Taran - Maths & Physics undergrad and president of the Cambridge Blockchain Society. Ask We are looking for the following: A grant of $10,000 to recruit an experienced solidity developer to complete the build of our protocol’s integration with Uniswap v3 DEX pool. Feedback on the concept and community development. We anticipate having a fully functioning protocol in testnet within the next few months. Funds We are currently bootstrapping and all expenses to date (approx $1,500) have come out of our own pockets. Links Google Drive file.",[],2021-08-30T16:03:48Z

We’d also like to experiment with other powerful implementations, such as: planting virtual trees that continuously offset carbon by plugging into protocols like Superfluid (https://superfluid.finance) + CO2ken (https://co2ken.io). Our vision for Atlantis is a democratized virtual world governed by its users where you can… Problem We believe existing virtual worlds in Web3 are clunky, difficult to load without interruption & neglect the flourishing DeFi ecosystem. On top of that, there are currently no virtual worlds or games that are embracing the community spirit of crypto / Web3 by enabling private & exclusive spaces gated by proof of token ownership (using standards including ERC20, ERC721, ECR155). This results in a landscape whereby virtual worlds:
a) aren’t accessible due to a high-cost barrier of entry, for example, a base requirement of purchasing the latest iPad or gaming PC;
b) communities can’t build or gather in exclusive, token gated spaces in games / virtual worlds;
c) users of virtual worlds are left without access to secure lending or high interests savings accounts whilst immersed in the ecosystem. Solution We are leveraging the power & familiarity of 2D spaces & easy-to-load pixel art to make virtual worlds in Web3 globally accessible, whilst integrating drop-in video calling like on https://gather.town and allowing our users to deposit interest-bearing assets such as Aave aTokens inside of any land parcels or buildings native to Atlantis World (which will be completely user-owned NFTs). Beyond that, we’re exploring DeFi & web3 integrations (IE with DAOHaus/Aragon → to enable gamified DAO experiences) to provide more value to our users & web3 communities.

18,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/building-rchili-liquidity/1262,Building rChili Liquidity - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,DamagedGoods," Description: Both the Chili & rChili coin have been launched with a token cap, and not too much functionality has been developed around them. With the plan offering grants and token distribution still being pursued, a major issue relates to the liquidity of the coin. For rewards to be built around rChili, it needs to be easy to enter the pool. Currently the pool size is around $15k of MATIC & rChili and would run into supply issues if rChili functionality started to be rolled out. Manifesto/Vision: Ideally rChili becomes the reward token received from the community based Chili token. Then rChili can be spent on prizes and such. It would be best to have a stable and incentivized liquidity of rChili to allow for new non Metacartelians to buy rChili prizes and enter the ecosystem. Problem: rChili’s small liquidity makes it difficult to purchase rChili if demand rapidly rises. Solution: The larger liquidity pool we have, the more resistant it is from price spikes. Additionally a proper and sustainable market for demand can not form if supply is irregular.

19,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/provide-rewards-for-rchili-matic-slp/1142,Provide rewards for rCHILI-MATIC SLP 👨🏻‍🌾 - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,PatrickG," The DAO should provide rewards for liquidity providers on Sushiswap (rCHILI-MATIC SLP). This is common practice in most DAO-governed communities. I’d like to put forth two proposals: Voting method: Snapshot vote for all CHILI token holders Voting method: MC DAO proposal on xDAI Data taken 6/28/21 185,500 CHILI claimed (1M total supply) 160,970 CHILI is staked (86.7% of all claimed CHILI ) Current staking APR is 621% (rCHILI) 83,333 rCHILI are being distributed during the current farming cycle, ending Sun Jul 25 2021 The next cycle begins Sun Jul 25 2021, with another 83,333 rCHILI rewards. By Aug 25th there will be 166,666 rCHILI in circulation. The rCHILI total supply is 166,666. There are no other discussions to mint more rCHILI at this time. Target APR: 200% rCHILI (enough to get degens out of bed)
Total circulating rCHILI: 166,666 by Aug 25th
Target liquidity percentage: 25% of total supply
Target liquidity in tokens: 41,666 rCHILI 200% * 41,666 / 12 months = 6,944 rCHILI rewards per month 6,944 * 3 mo. = 20,832 rCHILI to mint Note: All calculations for APR are in rCHILI tokens earned for 1 rCHILI staked. None of the calculations here have anything to do with the price of the token (as it should be). Also staking farms are APR not APY - there’s a BIG difference!

20,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/mcon-rchili-auction/1246,MCON rChili Auction - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,DamagedGoods," Hello Fellow MetaCartelians, I’ve been racking my brains thinking about how we can utilize rChili at our upcoming MCON event in September to make a real lasting impact for everyone that showed up. As a result I came up with the rChili Auction.  I’m posting this to gauge the thoughts and feelings of the guild. -Description: The functionality of Chili & rChili is currently still in a proof of concept. There has not yet been a real way to redeem your rChili that lives up to the power of the MetaCartel community(s). My proposal is to create an Auction at MCON and fill it with NFTs, items, and services sourced by the community (payment will be in rChili LP tokens).  This would be a feature of Chili and fall within my role as Chili community manager. -Manifesto/Vision: Rchili becomes a reward medium for social exchanges of values from one group to another. NFTs are an example of that, but so are fun services that groups can offer up. The functionality of Rchili needs to be centered around communities so hopefully an Rchili Auction can be an experiment to test out the communities willingness to exchange their Rchili. If this is successful, it will allow us to expand ChiliKitchen.com into a larger gallery (from different communities) for rchili redeemable prizes. Down the line we can also offer special prizes/incentives to anyone who purchased anything at the Auction -Problem: Currently Rchili has no redeemable value and the price floor has not yet been established. Additionally the liquidity is extremely low. AND Mcon needs swag, memorabilia, and other fun events to ensure it is burned into the minds of the attendees and FOMOers Solution: See product -Product: The product would be an auctionable event at Mcon (expiring on the final day) for all members to bid and their Rchili LP tokens ( and potentially have to create LP or purchase Rchili) for the reward that they prefer ( merch, NFTs, sponsored services, etc) -Validation: Hopefully this is where I’ll find validation -Progress: Some NFTs have been made and I have plans on coordinating with others to create a library as well -Differentiation: The fact that this will be in person and that it will be filled with MetaCartel Vibes -Team: Just me but I’m open to anyone who wants to jump on board -Grant Request $: $500-$4,000 (but this can be paid back from fees of auction in eth/rChili) -Funds: N/A -Help: YES! If there are any NFT lovers/ minters/ creators in MetaCartel (or its grantees) then it would be great to meet them! I’m still new to MetaCartel so it’s difficult to track everyone down! I would love some help engaging the MetaCartel and partner communities to offer up NFTs, objects, or services for auction. -Additional Resources: Design, Community love, Some chilikitchen.com design ( eventually), an NFT minting Guru ( or at least some of their thoughts), setting up LP tokens as payment (or just on Opensea) Please be sure to comment any ideas, feedback, suggestions, etc to move this idea along","[(<p>I love this idea and I’m pumped that you are thinking about ways to power the CHILI ecosystem, shared experiences are something that strongly resonate with the community in my mind, so whatever IRL things we can give attendees access to would be my first pick for prizes, followed by <strong>dope</strong> merch of course.</p>, 'Yalor'), (<p>What is the budget for ?

To create an onsite event request: 1st share your idea on Discord and get some emoji’s from DAO Members, let’s say 3 CHILI’s at minimum  2nd graduate your idea to a brief forum post including, what, when, where, why and how much you need to pull your idea/event off. I think a good range for these things is $500-$2500 depending on complexity and potential benefits to the community. ETHcc is just the starting point for events that will be happening now that restrictions are starting to lift, so I would love to see people thinking further ahead and planning some awesome events for our members to connect with each-other and the wider Ethereum community  Just to clarify any unused budget can roll over to the next season of events, the entire 10k does not need to be spent @ ETHcc.

 Hey MetaCartel - I was listening in on a DAOHaus call recently, and I heard some talking about Chilis, and the ambitions of doing some work focused on using a basket of tokens to incentivize projects. The post above is an idea I wrote up for 1hive this week. It’s basically a competitive league for monetizing youtube channels, by shipping 3-4 Skillshare Courses each month. Teams must ship 3-4 public skillshare courses to qualify for monthly distributions of a reward pool.
[over 4 months] Teams that qualify then compete with one another for what % of the reward pool they get to claim, based on the competence of their work – a handful of metrics. If a Team flakes or cheats, they are disqualified from receiving funding immediately, and eliminated. The trick is that if the Skillshare Courses are Public, then those courses can be published anywhere. There are some really neat subtle bonuses there as well. I got some feedback on this after sharing it with Brady McKenna over at District0x, and he suggested that District0x would be interested, and that I ought to make it a basket of tokens. The Proposal for 1hive is 60 HNY over 4 months, and it covers 5 teams. So it comes out to about 5k DAI worth of whatever token per team to participate, but the upside is incubating a few media channels for the MetaCartel. If this sounds compelling, please consider reading through the proposal on 1hive, and then volunteering a contribution to match funds, or sponsor a team. I’ll try not to spam your network, but if you find this an interesting experiment, feel free to pass it around, or share some thoughts on the 1hive proposal page. Thank you.","[(<p><strong>A couple questions for you:</strong></p>, 'Yalor'), (<p>This is a small business | media channel incubator.</p>, 'rootdraws'), (<p>Recording of topic discussed in its 1hive only form - before I opened it up to metacartel as a token reward basket.</p>, 'rootdraws')]",2021-07-18T23:24:39Z
24,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/tsunami-protocol-grant-proposal/1179,Tsunami Protocol- Grant Proposal - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,Kryptokelli," Tsunami Protocol Tsunami Protocol is a DeFi data marketplace making waves on Terra. Description Tsunami is a platform to revolutionize the data economy. It allows data consumers, data providers, and businesses or organizations to buy and sell data securely, efficiently, and with low fees. This is made possible by building on the Terra ecosystem and we will be utilizing Terra’s native stablecoin, UST, and eventually capture value of the platform using our governance and utility token, WAVY. Vision Ultimately, we want to further the mission of revolutionizing the data economy by making the process of data investing, and data access, simple for the user. We are in the process of partnering with Ocean Protocol Foundation and will incorporate Ocean’s datasets into our own marketplace. Additionally, we will be adding experimental and innovative elements like data indices, substrate compatibility, privacy data marketplace, etc. We aim to bring tokenized data into mainstream DeFi, such as auto-compounding yield farm data vaults with Apollo DAO, lending & borrowing of the most popular data token assets/indices via Mars Protocol, and simplifying the on-ramp process for data providers that aren’t familiar with DeFi and blockchain. We care about giving back and are excited to work closely with Angel Protocol to coordinate some percentage of revenue from each sale of a data token that goes to a specific charity endowment. Data providers can also specifically pledge revenue proceeds to charity endowments of their choice via our Angel Protocol smart contract integration. Problem
Some of the current challenges in the data economy includes: Solution The solution to these challenges faced in the data economy can be alleviated by using the blockchain because the blockchain encrypts dataset URLs. Once a dataset is uploaded, it cannot be tampered with or altered which solves the issue of security and allows for huge amounts of data to be monetized and made available to people globally. A DeFi data marketplace allows anyone from researchers to organizations to traditional data providers to upload their data and monetize it by using the blockchain that they traditionally wouldn’t have had access to in the past. Product Tsunami will enable a native Terra user to purchase and access an Ocean Protocol dataset using their UST (Terra) and Terra Station Wallet. It does this all while using Tsunami Protocol as the frontend and Ocean Protocol as the source for our prototype. We have plans to onboard and partner with other data providers with data from several different industry sectors. Validation
Even though we haven’t been very active on Twitter since joining in June, we have over 900 followers currently and are followed by Do Kwon (Founder of Terra Luna and TerraForm Labs). A large part of our following is from the Terra community. #LUNAtics Progress
We are currently in buidl mode and working on our prototype. We are a contender in the Next Top Blockchain Hackathon. Differentiation
Tsunami Protocol will partner with Ocean Protocol and use their marketplace as a building block which will allow us to bring new and innovative ideas to the data marketplace space that haven’t been done before. We will be the first data marketplace on the Terra ecosystem. We have a lot of ideas of what we would like to implement that are currently missing from crypto relating to buying and selling data and the data economy in general.

We could really use a grant of around $7,000 to help us pay for costs to get our prototype up and running.

LabelDAO is the first community funded record label. LabelDAO allows Members to pool capital, invest in unsigned artists, and share in any proceeds from the signings. Description
The thing that makes LabelDAO different from other record labels is that we’re enabling anyone who has a deep love for music, not just music industry insiders, to be at the forefront of pop culture by finding and developing the next superstar. We see a future where are many types of labelDAO ranging from geographic (i.e. Atlanta DAO for funding Atlanta artists) or event Artist LabelDAO’s (OVO Records / Drake’s Label as a DAO amongst Drake and his fans. Manifesto/Vision
The future of the music industry is collectives of artists and fans, investing and working alongside one another in the next generation of musicians. Soon, being a True Fan will be a full-time paid job. 2021 is the year that investing became mainstream culture. WallStreetBets taught people about investing, internet communities, and making money together. Culture then became investing. With NFTs, you could now invest in culture via digital art. The next step is combining the two where investing is culture and culture is investing Problem
Discovery crisis: There’s more music than ever (40K tracks per day uploaded to Spotify) but the methods of talent scouting have largely remained unchanged Predatory Financing: Record Label contracts are opaque and lopsided in favor of the label, largely due to lack of alternatives Building initial fanbase: Outside of making good music, artists’ biggest hurdle to getting their music heard is building their fanbase Solution
LabelDAO will a transparent label where its staff are financially and emotionally invested in their artists. Artists demand a financial infrastructure that is as open and accessible as the internet itself. By having an open application / voting system, LabelDAO is clear about how we make decisions on who we “sign”. Contracts will be standardized and public (think YC SAFE note), and marketing task to promote our artists will be open to the public. Product Validation
We already have an agreement with ADA (Warner Music Group independent distribution arm) to distribute the music and have secured Craig Kallman (CEO of Atlantic Records) as an advisor alongside Brandon Silverstein (Normani, Anitta, Lauv), Tunde Balogun (Summer Walker, 6lack), and Jesse Coren (Jeremy Zucker, Chelsea Cutler) Progress
Matt is working on the initial DAO smart contract will be ready for launch by the end of July. Differentiation
Matt and I have the full spectrum of music industry expertise from artist to label and experience in building product across both web3 and music experiences. Team
David Greenstein
David grew up in and around the music industry having started working at Atlantic Records at 15 and had a full time offer to join before heading to college. He has always been obsessed with where the music industry is headed, especially at the intersection of web3. More recently David served as a product manager at Pandora / SiriusXM on their music discovery product team and is a former YC founder (StreamReport) for a TikTok analytics tool that record labels used to discover emerging artists on the platform Gigamesh
Matt is known to some as Gigamesh, the music producer/DJ alter ego he performed under for the past decade. He topped billboard charts and toured globally, but in 2017 he tumbled down the crypto rabbit hole and forged a path toward a career in Web3 by working on products for Left Field Labs, Google, and Cisco. Matt is perfectly-suited for LabelDAO, combining years of experience in the music industry with his current role at Optimism, one of the most promising Ethereum scaling ventures."" Grant Request $

26,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/citydao-putting-land-on-chain/1175,CityDAO - Putting land on chain - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,citydao," CityDAO grant application Title CityDAO is putting land on the ethereum blockchain and creating a DAO to govern said land. Description CityDAO is building a city on chain, starting by tokenizing land in Wyoming. Each parcel of land is an NFT that can be owned collectively by the DAO collectively or by individuals. By taking advantage of Wyoming’s new DAO law, DAO LLCs can own land. This paves to way for digitizing ownership of land parcels. We are starting small by tokenizing Parcel 0, the first on chain community-owned and community-managed land parcel. Manifesto/Vision Land is just the beginning - CityDAO is building the city of the future. We believe in the Ownership Economy - where ownership and governance of land is controlled by people. CityDAO will provide a protocol that anyone can build on, for example, imagine community owned affordable housing or farms with income sharing and voting across a collective. Problem Land and real estate is opaque and illiquid. Most land is tied up in REITs (real estate investment trusts) which are groups of wealthy investors. Because land is not digitally legible, the current market is inefficient and slow. Solution CityDAO digitizes land, opening it up to crowdfunding parcels, easy, instant transfers, and compatibility with the DeFi ecosystem for things like lending. Product CityDAO version 1 is a single parcel of land in Wyoming, owned by the members of CityDAO. Future versions will include fancier governance mechanisms and expansion into real estate like apartments, farms, and industry. Validation We have a very engaged discord (~1,000 members) and support from Syndicate Protocol help launch and do DAO structure and consult on legal matters. Progress Initial website, 250+ interested in participating in first parcel launch, and incorporation of Wyoming DAO LLC. Next steps are mechanism design and implementation for Investor DAO which buys land and Community DAO which governs it. Differentiation There are companies like RealT which have taken a centralized approach to tokenizing real estate assets like apartments. Because of their emphasis on investing and returns, they have to do lots of KYC. We are aiming to build a decentralized, crypto-native UX like Uniswap for land. CityDAO will also be community-owned and governed, and interoperable with the ethereum ecosystem. Team Scott Fitsimones - founder of real estate tech company AirGarage. As we ran parking lots, I saw how inefficiently land was managed and transacted. By adding a digital layer on top of land, it can be liquid, transparent, open, and interoperable with crypto.

I’m using Giving Tree because it helps with my analogy here, but I’m open to names like:
HumanKind Project, Takes All Kinds, Human Kind DAO, That Kind DAO, Crypto Collective, Kind Kids on the Block, etc. DESCRIPTION A DAO which raises money to perform small, random acts of kindness. Think of it like a crowdfunding flash mob of kindness bent on spreading sunshine. MANIFESTO/ VISION Our mission is to do kind things for others in our community. With just a few dollars each, collectively, we believe small change can make a big difference in the world. PROBLEM The world lacks kindness. Many people want to do kind things, but they generally fall into two camps: People with money, but lack time. People with time, but lack money. SOLUTION Giving Tree is a tool/platform that makes it easy and fun to fund small, random acts of kindness collectively. It let’s people with money (and not much time) fund projects and feel good about spreading kindness, while letting people with time (and not much money), propose and carry out kind acts on behalf of the whole group. PRODUCT / HOW IT WORKS (one model) There are various ways to do this, and I’m open to suggestions, but one model is to create a tool that allows people to form their own kindness DAOs with their own network (e.g. 30-100 members). In a nutshell (extending this tree analogy), Giving Tree exists as a tool that allows people to set up their own network/DAO – let’s call them Giving Branches. Each branch can name their own DAO and set up their own rules. Their branch (ie DAO) can be a school classroom, an online choir group, a hockey team, a corporate agency, a blockchain project, or even a group of retired dads interested in beekeeping. Really any group. Each branch could also use their platform to help promote and market themselves (but that’s getting ahead of ourselves there). Here’s an example walk through, with a network of friends in Vancouver who decide to create their own branch called Kind DAO Step 1: Members form and join Kind DAO Each member contributes an equal amount of funds to the group pool (e.g. $100 USD, .01 ETH, 1 $FWB, etc.). E.g. Alice joins Kind DAO buy locking $100 USD. In total, there are 100 members, with a total fund of $10,000 USD. Step 2: Members submit proposals/ideas for ways to spend the funds (let’s call these Acts) In each proposal, the member includes: description of act, funds required, and other details. E.g. Alice requests $100 to leave 10 $10 gift cards in library books around the community. (You may want to cap funds at initial membership fee, so that members couldn’t request more $ than they locked in, and scam the system). Acts can be anything – from buying strangers dinner, donating to a local charity, gifting your local crosswalk attendee, or buying accessories for a public flash mob - but the goal would be to spend funds on people outside of Kind DAO Step 3: Members vote on proposals Step 4: Act is carried out Step 5: Funds are transferred Step 6: Awesome! From my experience, with a group of about 100 people: 90% are happy to just give money and sit on the sidelines, while 10% are more actively engaged to propose and carry out acts. OTHER MODELS: This platform could also allow for users to create their own rules. For example, maybe instead users can carry out acts immediately and spontaneously, and get redeemed later (through a consensus). Let’s imagine I witness someone do a kind gesture (like help a stranger move groceries), and I want to gift that person on behalf of my Kind DAO. I could give that person a gift/money, and later get redeemed by my network. VALIDATION I started a similar project (not as a DAO) nine years ago called Dollar Collective. At our maximum, we reached 100 members (most of whom I knew personally). But as our popularity grew, with coverage in the local news and being featured in the book
Happy Money, I started to receive money from strangers. Which is great, but they had no way of trusting me, or our collective. And organizing a voting process was tricky. Plus, while dealing with small amounts of money, we were losing out with each transaction due to fees, particularly for non-Canadian residents sending money. Blockchain and DAOs change all this: Here are some examples of things we did as the Dollar Collective: DIFFERENTIATION From Kickstarter to GoFundMe, there are hundreds of crowdfunding and lending projects online (including blockchain projects, like Giveth. But we are different in many ways: How do we differ from a charity? How do we differ from most crowdfunding projects, like Kickstarter? Advantage of networks: TEAM So far it’s just me. Dan Hawkins. The guy who started and runs Dollar Collective. I’m a jack of all trades, master of none. I work as an art director and writer. I also do UX research. I have experience with Javascript and Ruby On Rails. I developed a similar crowdfunding project called SmallChange that operates kind of like a Tinder x Kickstarter mashup, where you can find and fund projects around you with just $1 by swiping left or right. But I’ve never built anything on the blockchain. So I would need help! Plus, this is just a seed of an idea, I’d love to collaborate with others and create something together. You can reach me at dangrayhawkins@gmail.com ASK I’d love 9696 DAI and help. With funds, I can pay people to help realize this project. Specifically, getting help with the design and development. In terms of sustainability and creating value for initial funders (like Meta Cartel), there are different revenue models we could explore. For example, you could charge a small %fee on transactions that would go towards Giving Tree. This way, you could set up a treasury to help grow and maintain the platform (e.g. pay developers to build Dapp, etc.) Woof. That was a long post. Thanks for reading this!

Minty is a DAO platform that makes it easy for users to create secure asset pools for the purpose of crowdfunding, sharing, pooling assets, and licensing. We envision a future where anyone could pool money and assets around a shared strategy. There is no easy way to create and manage pools of physical collectibles and art. Because of this, the power of NFTs and DAO governance is lost on most people. Not only are most people excluded from the buying and selling of these novel instruments, but they are also unable to leverage their tangible assets to participate in the DeFi world. Minty makes it easy to securely participate in these pools by: With the NFTs created on Minty’s platform, individuals and DAOs can also use emerging DeFi solutions for leverage, diversification, and more.

I’m Alex, one of the founders of RenaissanceDAO. I’m excited to share what we’ve been working on and to ask for a grant from MetaCartel to support our efforts. Title
RenaissanceDAO Description
RenaissanceDAO is a decentralized collective of content creators interested in Web3 technologies. The DAO performs the role of a bridge between Web2 and Web3 while providing a collaborative environment for content creators to experiment with the future of monetization. Manifesto/Vision
RenaissanceDAO is exploring new models of creator patronage. We believe that we are going to be in a golden age for the patronage of creators because of the recent developments in blockchain technology. It is going to enable creators to finally own their work and to escape the Web2 trap of working for social media corporations and will allow them to become investors and owners in the new metaverse. We believe that content creators are going to be the early adopters that drive mass adoption of blockchain technology. Creators will be building their own platforms and ecosystems for their audiences using social tokens, NFTs, DAOs and Web3 technologies. We are imagining new futures and utilizing the metaverse to bring ideas into reality. Problem
Content creators are currently struggling in Web2 to earn a stable income. And there is a lack of content creators in Web3 to scale the entire ecosystem. There is no clear bridge for creators to transition from Web2 to Web3. Solution
A Web3 collective of creators that collaborate to create content and experiment with new models of monetization. We will enable creators to access benefits of the collective through a DAO. Product
Launch $REC membership / community tokens through the Rally Creator Coin program to explore membership perks and rewards for participation. The tokens are used to lower barriers to entry for creators that are not exposed to crypto, provide Discord and community access gating, and a payments infrastructure to pay creators in our ecosystem. We are implementing a DAO to coordinate partnerships and business development with blockchain companies, protocols and other DAOs. We have an active Discord Community. Validation
We currently have 20 creators interested in making content and getting rewarded. Their total audience is currently 1 million+ people. We have an agreement to launch a pilot program and partnership with Rabbithole.gg to work on initial content projects for protocols. Rabbithole.gg recently launched their Pathfinder program which is currently the v1 of the Rabbithole DAO and they will be outsourcing tasks to outside contributors. RenaissanceDAO’s content creators will be participating in contributing content and helping Rabbithole.gg develop and scale their content creation pipeline for their quests. We are preparing to list a workstream proposal with Gitcoin for content creation. Progress
We hosted our first events to recruit new content creators - expanded our group to 20 creators from 10 creators originally. We are launching our DAO through DAOHaus. Differentiation
We are focusing on the education of crypto/blockchain utility to a wide non-crypto audience. The way we improve our content quality is by pairing content creators with researchers in the blockchain field to provide credibility and background knowledge. Our goal is to curate a high quality group of creators to work in the web3 space together but have a wide reach in various creator niches (fashion, environment, music, art, etc). Team
Most of the team met through the Kernel Community. We all recognized the potential of web3 to help creators thrive and that there weren’t many ways to onboard content creators into crypto. Grant Request $

Problem Centralized live streaming platforms can do as they wish with your account, your content, your earnings, your rankings, your private information. They focus on maximizing profits while the experience sits stale. Solution A collectively owned and managed live streaming platform. The community curation and voting are completely gamified. Crowd members are rewarded based on participation, not just the performers. Current Product Create live streams Record live streams (automatic) Accept tips (ETH or ERC-20) Create video reactions during live streams (Live stream playback time synced) Wallet/Profile Upvote/downvote reactions Send a live stream chat message Signature based login Online status Product in the next few weeks: Reaction competition leaderboard Hodl to subscribe (Specific amount of any ERC-20) Create your Jeli Channel Schedule an event Progress Jeli quietly launched an early beta version of the product in June 2021. The initial version operates as a proof of concept to validate the hypothesis that a decentralized live streaming platform with novel gamified engagement interactions is compelling enough to get creators to switch and bring their fans over from a centralized platform. Video is streamed/recorded/served via livepeer technology, which runs on Ethereum. Sign up/login and Web3 interactions are handled by MetaMask. Validation The quiet nature of our launch is due to the cost of streaming and current lack of funding. We have received praise and encouragement from a small group of influential peers including the CTO of livepeer, as well as a member of this community who has previously been funded (and built something incredible) starting with a MetaCartel grant.  MetaDreamer tested and enjoyed the Jeli experience enough that he recommend we apply for this grant.  We need MetaCartel’s help to validate the product at the next level. Differentiation Today’s streaming platforms are centralized and/or lack an engaging experience. The extent of interaction between audience and performer on these platforms is minimal and interactions are limited to chatting and tipping. When going to a concert, a significant treasure of the experience is sharing the moment together/spotting some outlandish thing/seeing something hilarious/seeing someone inspiring with their dancing skills/people watching. We are recreating that experience digitally, in a way that rewards both sides in novel ways. Jeli rewards participants with JΞLI via token distribution airdrops based on participation and ranking. Live streamers are additionally rewarded directly from their fans via tips, subscriptions, and drops. Live streamers can also reward participants with in-stream wallet drops. Funds Jeli has taken 0 funding to date. This has been entirely bootstrapped by Mitchell Fox and tweaked via feedback from MetaDreamer. The requested funds will serve as the means to launch the new, ready-for-the-world version of Jeli.live Expenses include: Governance, curation, airdrop, tipping, minting contracts Marketing and outreach - Getting people familiar with Jeli, community building Launch Concert Series - Schedule a series of live performances with influential live streaming DJs/musicians. This grant will be used entirely to push Jeli forward to a successful public launch. Grant Request
9700 DAI Help We would like to ask any community members who are interested in contributing to reach out in the comments below or on Discord. Jeli must be a community owned protocol and we are happy to reward community members with governance tokens in exchange for contributions.

32,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/dao-proposal-swagpow-apparel-sales-platform/296,DAO Proposal: SwagPOW Apparel Sales Platform - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,burningfiat," UPDATE: The summoning and launch of SwagDAO has been suspended for the time being as we are exploring the potential legal implications of a revenue generating, product sales DAO.  The team at openesq.tech have independently been pursuing the launch of uniswag.io based on the Unisocks code base and experiment that was run previously this year. Due to this, they have also already addressed challenges specific to eCommerce product sales including wholesale product purchases, 3D printing, fulfillment, shipping, etc.  SwagPOW will partner with them to handle general product fulfillment and back office needs, as well as to explore the legal possibilities around how we can allow individuals to invest / share in the profits of a DAO-operated eCommerce store.  This project gives us a chance to explore the legal possibilities around revenue generating / profit sharing DAOs in a more controlled format. Aspects of the below proposal have been removed or modified to reflect these changes. SwagPOW WHAT: SwagPOW is a Swag Sales Platform (eCommerce site) where sales are conducted via Bonding Curve Auction + Battle Mechanic. It will be the underlying platform that powers the emergent SwagDAO. HOW: Leverage meme energy and competitive, FOMO3D-like game mechanics to increase FOMO and entertainment value / hype. WHY: Improve industry/ team swag designs and develop increased community engagement and culture across Ethereum. DETAILS:
SwagPOW is seeking a grant / membership pledge from MetaCartel to help subsidize the initial platform build and signal in support of this initiative. Funds will be deployed to develop the initial SwagPOW MVP that will include an eCommerce storefront powered by a bonding curve battle auction with swag price dropping over time (lowest price near end of the auction). Auction length determined by consumer interest with each new purchase resetting the sale timer for a short duration. This approach is akin to FOMO3D gambling / gaming mechanic where jackpot winner is based on the last person to purchase a ‘key’ with each key purchase resetting the expiration timer for a short amount of time. Two products (shirts) will be up for auction at any one time. All users initially pay full price, but winners will be credited with a refund once the auction / competition is over. Both shirt designs will be created and ship to purchasing users, but only ONE of the designs will ‘win.’ Profits from the losing shirt design will subsidize the early buyers of the winning shirt design. Losers pay $MSRP, while winners will only pay $COGS plus operational overhead costs and any agreed upon profit / sustainability cut for the platform. Early buyers will receive a refund / percentage of the later buyer’s purchase at the completion of the sale/competition. Sales/design competition will initially start at 30 days. Each purchase will add 24 hours (TBD) to the sale timer and total duration. Nice to Have: Each item sold will come with a unique NFT that represents that specific swag purchase. Secondary market sales will be hosted on SwagPOW platform and conducted via sale of NFT claims. For a limited period post initial auction (14 days?), purchaser can choose to list their claim and resell apparel to FOMO buyers who missed the auction sale.  Claim sales and fulfillment / shipping of apparel after the authorized period is the sole responsibility of the individual member. EFFORT:
Discovery: Model and define mechanics of a basic sale (without battle mechanic) including: Execution: Encapsulate discovery and final mechanics in solidity with final front end design TOTAL TIME: 8 Weeks COST:
Development: $6K USD
Design: $1K USD TEAM:
Ross Campbell, Robert Leonhard, Josh Ma (Primal/Open Esquire Team): Legal & Fulfillment
Keisaku + Tom Nash (Flex Dapps): Development
Ven Gist: Design
Darren Mills: PM
Eric Chung & James Waugh: Mechanics
Drew Harding: Janitor
You: ??? PROFIT/SUSTAINABILITY:
Team has initially discussed a small revenue cut (~5%) hardcoded into the platform that will go back to the MC / SwagDAO for funding the initial development of the platform and also to cover ongoing labor / operational / fulfillment costs. This is one of the questions that we intend to pursue and answer with the Open Esquire team. Sales priced in DAI, but held in cDAI/rDAI allows platform to earn interest while competition is ongoing and sale in concluded. EXPERIMENTATION:
This platform allows for experimentation and learning around revenue generating & profit sharing DAOs.  Our hope is that SwagPOW will inevitably be run and executed by a DAO itself, but we need to explore the potential implications and restrictions. We anticipate that this will also inform MetaCartel’s own direct interest in forming a revenue generating DAO in the near future. The platform also provides opportunities to explore traditional (banner / side bar), as well as crypto native (click here / watch this video for 1 DAI off your purchase) advertising opportunities. Most importantly, it is an opportunity for meme lords and crypto influencers to explore Ethereum through the lens of fashion and culture. How can we cultivate community beyond the tech?","[(<p>I’ve been thinking over the past few days about how an apparel/fashion company would be a great use case for a profit-generating LAOs so I’m super glad I found this post!

facebook2666×1500 299 KB
 Hello everyone, My name is Stabby. I’m one of the 4 founders of Doge DAOnation. For a short introduction, we are an organisation of people dedicated to using tokens currently stagnant in peoples wallets to generate APY returns and use the proceeds to grant funds to good causes. The system will be maintained through several contracts over two tokens, the Doge Daonation token ($DD), and our partnership network token, The Barkchain ($BARK). Though the idea is sold, and the cause pure, the real magic comes in the form of the way the DAO will be operated, and in the use cases it offers the partners that join the Barkchain. By accepting partner tokens and, with that, their communities tokens into our pools, we enable them to earn voting credits unique to their own community. These are then used to operate a use case that we apply to them through a mix of voting and interlaced smart contracts. This enables the communities of previously renounced contracts to make a difference as a unit to the token community they care for and those who need it in the “real world”. A destitute landscape for community-based tokens.
Currently, there is little to no widespread understandings of tokens, contracts, and their greater place within the Ethereum virtual machine and our everyday lives. Due to this, these same unaware people are being mislead, misinformed and outright scammed out of their legitimate value. Unused potential
Beyond the loss of value to cutthroat actors in the Ethereum space, few to none understand that the tokens themselves hold inherent value that can be utilised much like cash, through rather simple decentralised finance practices such as yield farming. This means that there is an incredible amount of lost APY sitting in the community token sphere. No hope in sight
Though the rate of adoption is increasing, especially in the past 6 months, the rate of understanding doesn’t seem to align. The more advanced technical knowledge will always be out of the grasp of the masses, so, without some kind of intervention, there will be more “dumb money” in the Blockchain space than “smart”. The Barkchain acts as a Haven for those who love buying Doge-style community tokens, but have been ‘bitten’ too many times by malicious developers. By forming a community of communities, decentrally controlled toward the goal of doing good, trust can be earned and old wounds overcame. We offer access to our pool to certain Doge tokens that meet our criteria. This access highlights that the tokens being stored can be used for other purposes, selfish or not. Should our partners community members opt to stake into the pool, 80% of the staking rewards will be distributed into our “Funding Pool”, where it will be distributed to good causes based on the voting of the DAO members, and the remaining 20% into the DAO treasury, to be distributed for system maintenance and upgrades. We’re fully aware that DAO’s require a strong base incentives in order to stay operational. We take this fact and double down by stating that every good action should be rewarded. These micro rewards enable people to give as much or little time as they wish to help good causes and be rewarded meritocratically for their efforts. Work began on the DAO structure one month ago today and will continue for the next 10 days before launch. We have developed multiple contracts within 2 tokens and are currently in the testing phase. Auditing will take place this week and token information released prior to launch. We are confident and excited to begin work on the greater DAO. Our greatest challenge comes in the form of marketing. We do not wish to employ the use of twitter shillers and the like, so as not to draw the wrong crowd, and this has proven a road bump to an otherwise uncompromising success. As we progress through these final 10 days, we feel that the most critical thing is to gain traction for our launch. Our DAO formed out of the founders attempts to enable a use case onto an already locked contract. The logical hoops that we jumped through ended with us inventing a new way to compute use cases and achieve heterogeneity at the same time. By having a DAO of DAOs built to move purposefully slowly, security, stability and growth can be monitored maintained and where necessary, tweaked. Due to profit not being our goal, the primary function of funding good causes is always passively achieved in the background. This gives our token real use that will keep people invested and coming for more despite the slow “evolution”. We believe that meticulously crafting the network functions to be able to last a theoretically infinite amount of time and remain heterogenic is the optimal way to form our network. $4500-$10000 in Ethereum Thus far, the project has been entirely funded by the 4 founders and a handful of our developers. Through website development, marketing materials, and token development, we have spent roughly $4000. We expected our total expenditure to lay between $4500-$1000, though it is now looking toward the latter. Our upcoming expenses include:
*Paid advertising - We need to reach the right people before launch and this is the healthiest way to do so with what time we have.
*Marketing materials - We have an explainer video that we are very happy with, however there’s still a bit more explaining to do and it would be great to have an intro video too.

34,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/web3bridge-cohort-v-grant-proposal/1064,Web3Bridge Cohort V grant proposal - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,Ebunayo," Hello,
On behalf of the team and program participant of Web3bridge, I am happy to say thank you to the Cartel for the previous grant funding provided to us Web3Bridge Grant application - #12 by Ebunayo. We are excited to mention that the $3000 grant that was used during cohort III to fund mid way hackathon gave birth to safekeep.finance project which is presently in beta testing stage and we are already discussing funding to scale the project. Also as part of the impact of the program across Africans, we are glad to also state that 5 of the participants of cohort II & III are actively employed as Junior and intermediate solidity developers and are earning better than they were when they were doing web2 development. Since the last funding, Web3bridge has successfully close another cohort and we have another project in the pipeline that will be launched from the cohort. Also, with the reviews we have done with the program, we decided to lease a building in Lagos to serve as the office space and hostel facility for Cohort V, we took this decision to increase rate of completion of the program and with this facility we will be able to host and train 40 developers (30 male and 10 female) up until we are able to secure a bigger place. Thankfully, setting up the office have been possible with the little contribution we got from GR9 and the large part of the funds released by the team. However, we are requesting a grant of $15,000 to fully complete the set-up and prepare for the cohort. The fund will be expended on acquisition of bootcamp bed ($4,760), provision of internet network ($1,619) and equipping the facility with solar systems ($8,619) to provide uninterrupted power supply during the cohort. Our expectation from this cohort is 100% completion rate and an intense training that will afford us the opportunity to graduate intermediate blockchain developers to fill up the growing demand for solidity and frontend developers in the space and also we look forward to supporting the growth of two projects for the community. Thanks","[(<p>** edit: <em>I love Web3Bridge generally and want to support the projects coming out of it now. Looking forward to hearing about the ecosystem progress.

I agree with <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/scottrepreneur"">@scottrepreneur</a> in that you should send your participants (their projects) for funding from MetaCartel but this seems like an even higher impact thing to do &amp; imo totally in line with MetaCartel’s spirit of “if you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together” &amp;<br/>

by ETHTurin Meetup Group PREAMBLE PROPOSITION FLOW
Alice, Bob and Charlie wrote a Song together. They want to deposit their copyrights on the Ethereum Blockchain. Alice will access the Registry via a proxy contract or a Certification Authority that provides for her ID. She opens a new Deposit and starts by creating a simple wallet, or multi-sig wallet with her co-authors Bob and Charlie. In case of the multi-sig, the multisig will be created only upon acceptance (signature) by Bob and Charlie. Once created, the wallet can start issuing copyright deposits. Alice will create a Song Instance and  upload the .zip necessary materials for the deposit: an audio file and pdf with a proof of the musical score and/or lyrics. Upon multi-signature approval (message sign), the .zip material is hashed on the IPFS and a CID (and possible gateway url) is generated and returned. Once the .zip package has been hashed on IPFS, Alice will divide all the copyrights of music, lyrics and arrangements amongst Bob, Charlie and herself via a Deposit Form. Upon submission and Form multi-sig confirmation, a submitCid() function will take each member’s quota, the IPFS CID, and send them to the Registry Smart Contract. PAYMENTS
When performing or publishing of the copyrighted material, the copyright-Using Party will access the Registry Contract via a Payment Form where the option for Live or Online Publishing will be selected and resulting fee generated. In case of partial use of the copyright (say, use of only music or only lyrics), it will be possible for the Using Party to select such options and to include/exclude certain right holders. As an incentive to declare the use of copyrighted material, the Using Party is rewarded with ERC1238 ‘badge’ tokens (or POAP) that will grant him/her voting power in the CMO, as well as participation in periodical lotteries. STORAGE
The Ethereum CMO will harness storage capacity from white-listed IPFS peers, or an own gateway of IPFS nodes provided by national CMOs. In this scenario, in order to guarantee the permanent storage of each deposit, IPFS nodes provided by national CMOs will be rewarded by deposit fees. COPYRIGHT TIE-IN
When depositing a new composition that uses part of e.g. Sting’s “Roxanne”, Bob can tie-in his new deposit to Sting’s composition, specifying the extent of the copyright usage. Sting will then accept or refuse the connection. Upon acceptance, a new multi-sig wallet between Bob and Sting will be created for the opening of the new deposit instance on the Registry. By tying-in his copyright to “Roxanne”, Bob’s Song will be inserted into Sting’s Copyright Tree. Being listed into Sting’s Copyright  Tree will earn Bob exposure to Sting’s fanbase as well as to Merchants interested in using the “Roxanne” mood for commercial purposes. Inevitably, the Copyright Tree will also provide a real-time, on-chain way to catalog music history. Should Bob not decide to tie-in his Roxanne-inspired Song to Sting’s copyright, Sting will be able raise a Dispute within the CMO by staking a given amount of ETH. A community vote amongst the badge-token holders will take place and determine the flagging (or not) of Bob’s Song. FLAGGED: Sting gets his stake back, Bob’s Song is black-listed and unable to receive payments. NOT FLAGGED: Sting loses his stake, his supporters penalized in future votings and Bob’s Song deposit remains untouched. Both Sting and Bob can also decide to skip the community vote and go via traditional proceedings. To this extent, the appearance of on-chain arbitration chambers and ODRs like the ones powered by JUR represent a valuable player that can be empowered within the CMO with a relative majority stake. HOW CAN METACARTEL HELP
We are looking for funding to run our Fete de la Musique Hackathon this coming 21st of June 2021 and lay down a first PoC of the Multisig, Registry contract and Tie-in system.
The Hackathon will go along a two days livestream featuring musicians, talks and workshops inherent to music and blockchain.",[],2021-05-28T14:45:43Z

Vodra is a decentralized donation platform that allows content creators to be supported by their audiences directly. There is a growing shift towards donations/pledges as a medium to compensate creators which directly increases creator and audience engagement. Our goal is to allow creators to pursue their passions while being fairly compensated and increasing creator and audience interaction. The main issue we are trying to tackle the main issue is fair compensation for content creators, which is difficult for them to achieve. Due to advertiser preference, algorithm changes, censorship, and other restraints it is increasingly more difficult for creators to earn a living and create the content that matters to them. Between exuberant platform fees, which can go up to 45%, and algorithmic discrimination, it’s hard for content creators to receive fair compensation without leaning fully on advertisements and promotions. We believe the purpose of entertainment is to entertain people, not sell things. The current model also places little importance on audience-creator interaction, and on producing the content that audiences want to see. There is a growing shift towards donations/pledges as a medium to compensate creators which directly increases creator and audience engagement, but existing donation platforms are still plagued by high fees and centralization. Vodra is a decentralized donation platform that allows content creators to be supported by their audiences directly while increasing their interaction. The Vodra Platform allows direct donations, crowdfunded project voting, and scheduled reward donation tiers, all with 0 fees. The Vodra token is also disseminated to creators based on the size of their audience, at a decreasing rate, giving back control of the value exchange of content to the creators, and compensating them for both audience size and engagement. Our team has grown to 13 members, all from being fully bootstrapped, and we’re currently hard at work on building the platform. We’re working on our backend services in order to read and handle incoming transactions and append extra information to them such as messages from audience members and their profiles. We have also designed the UI for the client-side application and are at work building our MVP for this summer. We have partnerships with many prominent content creators in many different domains, including a professional surfer, financial influencers, streamers, an MMA fighter, and much more. These content creators have a combined audience of over 100M, and are helping to grow our communities, and will be strong advocates and early users of the Vodra Platform. Vodra is unique from all other creator compensation projects due to its donation platform model coupled with creator redemptions. Vodra enables proportional participation in the platform by creators without the need for individual creator currencies which often find themselves illiquid or unrepresentative. Vodra also provides a suite of tools completely dedicated to creator compensation through donations. Creator compensation is at the core of Vodra and every platform function is designed to perpetuate that. By building a creator donation economy that is devoid of third parties, Vodra allows for participation and ownership that is unafforded by other projects. With creators being directly incentivized to utilize and promote the platform, there is an unprecedented opportunity for mass creator adoption. It is this clear value proposition and network effect that sets Vodra apart not only from other blockchain compensation models but also from the big fiat players such as Patreon and Twitch Bits. Our full team can be found here: https://vodra.io/team, along with their LinkedIn profiles. $10,000 USD as well as your feedback and support. The Vodra team has currently taken no funding and is fully bootstrapped and self-supported out of pocket from its founders. The requested grant would serve to support our growing dev team, pay for necessary services and infrastructure, and allow us to effectively manage our token and help get the Vodra Platform in the hands of creators as soon as possible. Documentation and our social media groups can be found on our website, linked above.",[],2021-05-07T00:19:02Z

A common misconception around the world is that ‘hacking’ specifically means coding or software development. This is simply not true, and to prove it we’re inviting all types of hackers to join us on this quest. Whether you’re a designer, illustrator, artist, writer, philosopher, blogger, marketer, game designer or hold any of a plethora of other skills, we want to help you build on Ethereum! The remote format of Dragon Quest will set a new standard for virtual events. We will engage a diverse and global audience to support and sponsor their development of the Web3 ecosystem. To learn more please check out the following resources: Announcement Website Discord The end deliverable will be a MetaCartel Virtual Hackathon format that can be deployed on demand. We have already started executing prelaunch to coordinate volunteers and engage with hackers. The event officially kicks off April 1st and we will have content and workshops throughout the month. The hackathon lasts 30 days and will conclude with prizes in early May. This also allows the community of MetaCartel ecosystem Dapps to get loads of exposure to hackers and deploy bounties inside the Discord.

38,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/proposal-authentik-social-media-nft-marketplace/1021,Proposal: Authentik - Social Media NFT Marketplace - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,sam," An NFT marketplace designed for social media creators, specifically Youtubers and TikTokers. A platform for social media creators to sell digital assets. Not limited to just an NFT marketplace, but also supporting a Shopify-esque experience for creators to plug and play digital asset stores into their personally branded sites. Social media creators put enormous effort into developing content for their personal brands, but they have limited control over how they monetize this content. Some can post on platforms which will pay them ad revenue (Youtube) but the creators have no control over their ad-rates, and are susceptible to the platform’s monetization decisions. Others (TikTokers) have no direct revenue streams for their digital content, they rely on their following and stature to funnel other streams of revenue (merch, brand deals). Moreover, Virality is under-monetized, especially so for smaller creators who struggle to monetize their organically viral content. A platform that enables social media creators to seamlessly convert their content into digital assets on the blockchain that they can sell to their following. This product is best-suited to be a dapp because it is critical that the digital assets are “authentik”-ly produced by their true creators to give them value. Features Intended for an Initial Release: Long Term Product Targets: Proof of Industry (we’ll keep this short): Proof of Market: Our team is working hard to develop this idea. We estimate that we are about two weeks out from a beta-launch that would fully support the Youtube platform.

39,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/proposal-pr-ce-seasonal-stock-market/1020,Proposal: Pr!ce - Seasonal Stock Market - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,sam," A seasonal market place for semi-fungible tokens representing shares in NBA players (like a season-long stock market for basketball fans). A community driven basketball community built on Ethereum. Our goal is to create a fun community that brings basketball fans into crypto, and is true to its fans. Not a centralized league or betting website, a true open market concept built for fans. Fantasy sports users want to add financial stakes to their leagues. Sports betting is focused on individual games or specific series: its scope is too narrow. There isn’t a way of “putting your money where your mouth is” behind the general success of a group of your favourite players. A platform that enables basketball fans to engage with their favourite players like a stock market. Users can buy shares in their favourite players and receive dividends based on their real-life performance. This allows fans to get behind the idea of “supporting their favourite players” and add some fun stakes into the mix. Proof of Community: We have a working beta version of our platform which is ready for deploy. It is not currently live on mainnet because we were unsure of the correct way to time our initial release since the minting of our tokens was intended to correspond with the start of the NBA season, however, we may be able to coincide with the start of the playoffs to do a release this year. However, we do have concrete examples of the state of our project and its functionality. Here is the devfolio link to our submission to ETH Denver: https://devfolio.co/submissions/stonks-9f8d Here is the link to our demo video for an alpha version (excuse the audio, we had to speed up the video to meet time requirements): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9Gg32HvoHQ We have since iterated on our hackathon version to support price graphs, improve our security standards and improve the cleanliness of our codebase. We are not a fantasy sports league. We are not a sports betting site. We are a platform for the sports community that acts more like a stock market. We are a platform for people to get behind their favourite players and invest in them over the course of the season. What sets us apart from NBA TopShot is that we are not selling NFTs of highlights or moments. We are offering a unique experience for users to “invest” in their favourite athletes and players for the duration of the NBA season. We’ve discussed with TopShot about integrating with their platform, or building pr!ce as a second layer application to TopShot, but are currently focused on doing this on our own. We are different from Sorare because we aren’t developing a fantasy league/game. We don’t try to compete with fantasy, or facilitate league matches. We are offering a stock-market system. We focus on token economics, and creating an interesting, liquid market as opposed to developing a game. We are distinct because of our versatility. Pr!ce employs a 3 tiered incentive model. Traders can play the market backed by our AMM and liquidity pools. Basketball fans can reap the benefits of real life statistical performance, through dividends. Collectors can engage in battles with other collectors to earn our Champion NFTs (by way of becoming top owning holders of a share), introducing market volatility via targeted trading. Abstractly, we are a way for people to invest in both on-chain value (market value) and off-chain value (statistical performance). This core concept is versatile and applicable to any theoretical asset.

41,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/proposal-commitpool-v1/997,Proposal: CommitPool V1 - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,spengrah," CommitPool empowers you to hold yourself accountable to your personal goals.  A global community of people holding themselves accountable to achieve their personal goals, powered by a DAO-governed protocol.  Curating and implementing a broad range of commitment types while ensuring that they are non-gameable and use reliable data sources is a critical job, and it must be done in a decentralized manner to preserve the protocol’s neutrality. Therefore, the fully realized CommitPool vision includes a DAO to govern the protocol. Humans are bad at achieving the goals we set for ourselves. We want to get in better shape, learn a new skill, or wake up earlier. Yet despite our promises to ourselves, many of us struggle to follow through on these goals because we procrastinate when it comes time to put in the necessary work. Our own accountabilty toolset – which consists primarily of internal motivators like our sense of self-worth – is often not strong enough. We need outside help. We need external incentives. The challenge is creating these incentives in a way that can’t be gamed. If I’m in charge of penalizing myself for not meeting my own goal, it’s extremely easy for me to cheat. Conversely, if I put somebody else in charge, I have to trust them to not cheat me. Putting smart contracts in charge avoids both those problems. CommitPool’s protocol allows users to program their goal(s) into a contract (e.g. bike 20 miles this week), and stake DAI on this commitment. If a user doesn’t reach their goal, the protocol slashes their stake. No games, no interpretation, just cold hard credibly neutral incentive. Direct financial incentives are very strong motivators, possibly the strongest motivator. If we can harness their power in the context of personal goals, we can help people follow through on their promises to themselves where they have fallen short before.

Commitment applications as a solution have been tested in a Web2 environment, and their success has proven the appetite for these tools. However, so far, none of the existing applications has managed to solve the trust issue, which significantly limits their effectiveness. Web3 is the right paradigm for this, and we believe that a decentralized version, one that can’t cheat its users, is the future of personal productivity. The primary constraint is the oracle problem. CommitPool commitments must have reliable data sources that cannot be gamed or unduly influenced. While there are currently few such data sources, we anticipate that as more of life moves on-chain and as oracle technology matures, the number of viable commitment types will grow substantially. Until then, we are starting small and simple. V1 focuses on distance data from Strava, enabling people to commit to biking and/or running a X distance over the course of Y days. This is single-player mode. Stakes are not pooled and there are no positive incentives from rewards (though we potentially could subsidize). Our plan is to ship V1 to gain traction, start building a community, and iterate on our product and UX before investing in V2. V2 will introduce pooled stakes and all the awesomeness that enables, as well as the infrastructure to introduce new commitment types, governance, and stake pool management. The full monty. We have an MVP that is live and functioning (app + contracts) on Polygon mainnet. Our dapp has integrations with Strava, Chainlink, and Torus, and can be used on web or a mobile browser. To move beyond our MVP and ship a proper V1, we need to put time into… CommitPool is seeking a grant in the amount of 6,500 DAI, to be used for the following purposes: The CommitPool team is: CommitPool is a founding and active member of UberHaus, and is, well, committed to a collaborative and community-first approach.

I am creating a dApp that would be a space for academic scientists to propose individual experiments (ie an ethereum wallet) in a searchable environment that then investors can seek topics of interest to donate funds. In short, each experiment would be an ethereum wallet with a smart contract containing the experimental details (ie personnel, cost breakdown, plans for data dissemination). Once the ‘goal’ of the ethereum wallet is met, the scientist converts this into USD (or whatever) and conducts the experiment. Then, this lab group, as bound by the smart contract, loads the results of the study back into the wallet that funded the study, thus disseminating the data to all those involved in the transaction. I am using truffle + ganache to develop this application, however I am a postdoc researcher at hopkins with limited coding experience. Funding from this community would go towards hiring developers trained in decentralized app development to help deploy the DeFund app. I look forward to feedback! -Matt",[],2021-03-31T14:08:48Z

It was awesome to be able to share with MetaCartel all the progress that meTokens has been making. For anyone who was not on the call, feel free to drop your questions below in the thread and I’ll be sure to answer them as quickly as possible. An automated market maker to create, secure, and exchange personal tokens It is easier to predict who will be a successful person than it is to predict what will be a successful product or company (Source: Naval). Unfortunately, there is no way to invest in people directly even though they are the source of all value creation. Economically sound personal tokens. Investors should be rewarded for staking money on a person early on if, later, they become more productive or popular. Conversely, people who are staked upon should experience an acceleration in the rate of their attainment of success as a direct result of their token holders’ involvement. image960×540 79.2 KB meTokens launched an alpha version of the protocol on mainnet in April 2020 as the first official project to come out of the Raid Guild. The initial deployment operated as a proof-of-concept to validate the hypothesis that collateralized personal tokens, issued by a novel “discount” AMM, could feasibly operate on-chain. The experimental design proved functional and garnered a loyal initial user-base. While technically functional, the alpha revealed a significant number of opportunities for improvements, including: Each of these innovations has been rolled into a completely new version of meTokens, which is currently in the final stages of development, along with a brand new, more content rich, social dapp platform. All of which will be made open source upon release. meTokens are critically different from any other personal token design because their supply and distribution is managed entirely by a custom built AMM, not a centralized issuer. The AMM ensures that all meTokens are properly collateralized with real underlying value, and that this value is predictably skewed in favor of a single address recipient - the “owner” of the meToken. The owner of the meToken is provided with no special administrative privileges, which allows meTokens to remain uniquely trustless - an important feature when considering how meTokens ought to achieve composability with the rest of DeFi. image979×542 84.8 KB 9,500 DAI & your help meTokens has taken 0 funding to date. It has all been built out of pocket and through generous early contributions from Chris Dixon, CarlFarterson, MetaDreamer, Ven Gist, Darren Mills, Sam Kuhlmann, and the rest of the RaidGuild family. The requested funds will serve as a bridge to launch the new, ready-for-prime-time version of meTokens. Expenses include: None of this grant will be retained by the core team members. It will be spent immediately to get the product closer to shipping. We would like to invite any and all community members who are interested in contributing to reach out in the comments below or on discord. meTokens needs to be a community owned protocol and we are happy to reward community members with governance tokens and additional funding in exchange for contributions.

45,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/dao-proposal-sherlock/922,DAO Proposal: Sherlock - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,Jack," Hey MetaCartel! Been following you guys for a while and excited to finally be posting a proposal! Sherlock’s goal is to bring DeFi to mass adoption. One of the biggest blockers we see is the security of DeFi. Audits are great but they aren’t 100% effective. Existing insurance is missing the mark and covers less than 3% of TVL in DeFi. Sherlock has a novel approach that we’ve already gotten a ton of validation for. Existing insurance fails mainly on two fronts: affordability and user experience. Sherlock makes insurance affordable by selling wholesale to protocols and integrating an internal team of smart contract security experts to accurately price insurance in DeFi (something that is sorely missing). And Sherlock makes the user experience easy by working with protocols to insure their TVL so users never need to worry about insurance – they are always covered. At the heart of the protocol, there’s a pool of tokens that’s set aside to reimburse hacks for any of the protocols we cover. There are 3 main parties who interact with the pool: Protocols
Protocols pay a small fee in exchange for full coverage against hacks. The fee is decided by our team of security experts who conduct diligence on the protocol and decide on a fair price. Stakers
Stakers put tokens into the insurance pool in exchange for one of the highest yields in DeFi. Protocols fees go into the pool and contribute to the yield for stakers. In the event of a hack, funds contributed by stakers reimburse the users of the hacked protocol. Security Team
Our internal security team does research on protocols who want coverage and gives them a price for that coverage. The team’s compensation is based on the return to stakers. If stakers get more fees from protocols, the team’s compensation will be higher. If stakers pay out significant amounts for hacks, the team’s compensation will be lower. image1538×1120 179 KB Sherlock was created in the MarketMake hackathon in February. You can see our project here. We’ve since re-branded to Sherlock – would link but Discourse won’t let me post more than two links  and are working on a mainnet launch which we see coming in 6-8 weeks (including audits). We’ve gotten really great responses from customers and are working super closely with Badger DAO ($1.5Bn TVL) to be one of our first customers when we launch. Other customers on our waitlist include Matic/Polygon, PieDAO and Superfluid. Jack Sanford (full-time): Biz Dev / Full-stack (jack__sanford on twitter)
Evert Kors (full-time): Backend / Smart Contracts (Evert0x on twitter) 5000 DAI to get Sherlock to mainnet. Since we’re building out an internal smart contract security team, we think we can get massive discounts on audits (or free ones hopefully), so we need funding to bridge our frontend guy so he can leave his job as well as for deploying contracts to mainnet. We have finished the protocol design (can share that with you guys soon) and we’re translating it into Solidity which should take about 3 weeks. Our frontend is on a similar timeline and we think we can get audits done over the course of the following 2 weeks. Our goal is to get 5 protocols covered with our insurance and we think we can hit that in the next 3 months. Check us out on Twitter for more info (pinned) about our protocol as well as for updates! And feel free to reach me at jsanford9292 on Telegram. Looking forward to your feedback!","[(<p>Interesting idea! Theres definitely room for more insurance, I wish Furucombo had some for me last week.

I am creator of the StreamPay protocol, and now I want to introduce the DAISO which one of the winner project of Kleros hackathon to get some fund.
We hope the DAISO could enable good project to obtain investors’ funds and reduce investors’ risks. DAISO: Merge streaming money into DAICO, and Decentralize Arbitration solution the disputes from the project and investors. Alice submitted a proposal on January 20th for withdraw stream balance to pay smart contract audits fees and developer salaries. In proposal, it Indicates the use of funds. It was voted by investor and successful withdraw when voted pass. The voting closes on January 21 and lasts for 24 hours. At end of the voting time, Alice’s DAI stream balance is 21978.09, and it is the maximum withdrawal amount. The investor voting weight uses the SDAI stream balance at the start of the voting time, the sum of the pass and notPass stream balance is the voting result. When Alice withdraw 20000 DAI, Alice did not deploy the project to the test network and did not began smart contract audit. The investors refuse to Alice’s withdrawal proposal in order to urged Alice could fulfill the promise as soon as possible. Finally,  Alice deployed the project to the test network and signed the smart contract audit contract. Finally, Alice’s withdraw proposal was passed once again. When Alice withdraw 50000 DAI, the smart contract was not deployed to the main network. Bob was completely dissatisfied with Alice’s behavior, so he submitted to the Kleros Court for the Arbitration. The reason was that Alice had not fulfilled her promise, and the Kleros Court judged that Alice had not kept her promise according to the actual situation. Alice appealed, but Kleros keep the original judged. When the project party first loss the arbitration, it will pay a certain penalty in order to obtain a certain change period. And when the project party loss for third, the fundraising stream was cancelled, the DAI and SDAI stream balance of the investors was returned. And the DAI stream balance of the project will contribute to investors in a certain proportion.
In the arbitration period and change period, the project can’t withdraw from the stream balance. Another investor, Carl, who invested $5,000 and wants to cancel on March 1 due to personal reasons, so he can choose to cancel stream. At this time, Carl has withdrawn 10,000 SDAI from the stream balance, and now Carl’s DAI stream balance is 1703.297 and SDAI stream balance is 22967.033 on March 1. After cancelling the stream, the stream balance will be automatically withdrawn to its wallet address. It could influence the project stream that rate per second of project for stream is decrease. To develop this project we ask for 6 000 DAI mainly to cover the audit fees. To be executed during Q42020.

Feedback more than welcome!  Vocdoni is a universally verifiable and anonymous voting infrastructure extensible to token-based governance. vocdoni_bridge_header1024×512 125 KB We aim to make e-governance available to all while meeting the highest standards of sovereignty, security, accessibility, privacy, resiliency and traceability. To this end, we are leveraging the latest advances in cryptography, blockchain and distributed systems to develop an open source technology (Vocdoni Open Stack) to work as a L2 for governance. We have developed the first ever trustless end-to-end (E2E) verifiable and anonymous voting system, which was designed from the start to be used from a smartphone, along with a distributed infrastructure that maximizes resilience, neutrality and transparency. We believe this combination can enable the mass-adoption of e-voting and make civil participation dramatically easier than ever before. Highlights So far we have build two different products that make use of Vocdoni Open Stack: Vocdoni_voting_process_arch873×660 29 KB Vocdoni also has a set of tools like the Vocdoni Explorer , a simple, easy-to-use web application which empowers voters and third-parties to interface with the Vochain at a higher-level. It enables anyone to view & verify the contents of Blockchain data (blocks and transactions) as well as human-meaningful records such as entities, processes, and vote envelopes. Although our software is mainly focused on the traditional market, we are aware about the growing need in the crypto world for cheap, secure and privacy-centric governance solutions. That’s why we decided to build Vocdoni Bridge on top of Vocdoni Open Stack. Vocdoni Bridge aims to improve the process of signaling/voting for the token holders of an EVM compatible token. Given that is near to impossible to execute this process on-chain (due to gas costs and tx processing) Vocdoni Bridge offers a L2 scaling solution based on Tendermint that uses Ethereum or xDai as a source of truth. Current existing solutions are: Vocdoni Bridge improves on the current solutions by: To achieve this we rely on the Vocdoni Open Stack infrastructure and add a few components to act as a bridge between token holders and decentralized verifiable governance. The most relevant one is the monitoring service that tracks holders and generates censuses of the accounts that hold funds of a given token. These censuses are compatible with the existing governance infrastructure, no additional effort is required.

Medium: @mindful-cash Ever told yourself you’ll take profits but waited far too long? Ever sold the bottom and then bought back higher? Ever FOMOed into an asset at the top after it went 10x? Mindful was built out of a need. As DeFi natives ourselves, we wanted to learn from our mistakes and calm our degenerate tendencies. With Mindful, you can adopt strategies to mindfully DCA into assets, create auto rebalancing portfolios (Chakras), and take profits automatically. Set your own strategy, or follow a guru. Mindful’s intuitive UI guides users seamlessly through the Chakra creation and strategy-setting process. Built on Ethereum, it works with all major wallets and ERC20 assets. With Mindful, we hope to enable other crypto traders to invest mindfully, take the emotion out of trading, and actually realise profits instead of riding gains back down to the bottom. We built the first version of Mindful for ETHGlobal 2020  where we placed as a finalist and won a prize from Balancer Labs. Since then, we’ve been working towards a mainnet release - targeted for late November / early December. Features of the V1 mainnet release include: We also intend to get everything audited prior to release - wouldn’t be very mindful of us to test in production. Aside from the features mentioned above, we have a few other ideas on how to extend Mindful’s functionality and the value that it provides users. Some of these include: We’re applying for the ETHOnline Post-Hackathon Support Program to help us build and release the first version of Mindful on mainnet. At this stage, the team is treating this as a side project until we’ve released, tested with users, and found product-market fit. Mindful is currently in a post-hack state - there’s a good amount of work to be done to push us to our first mainnet release. With that said, we are primarily looking for funding so that we can contract a reputable firm to conduct an audit of our code and contracts. Funds will also be used for any infrastructure costs (e.g. Infura, hosting, contract deployment etc). MetaCartel has been a key entity in the DeFi and DAO ecosystem - we hope to work closely with the community to get feedback and support from some of the most informed players in the space. The Mindful team is comprised of a bunch of decentralised DeFi degens. We’ve hacked together at multiple events including:  ETHCapeTown , Diffusion ,  Kyber DeFi Virtual Hackathon , ETHBerlin .

The goal of the project is to grow the global blockchain community in the locations where people’s lives will be most transformed by the impact - in developing countries. By telling a story that is culturally relevant, we can help our readers see a future that is free from the issues they experience in their daily lives, while also providing them with the tools to create that future. The book will directly cover the basics (including DAOs), but it will also link to learning resources and training opportunities to help readers take the next step to becoming crypto users, entrepreneurs, and developers. We want to inspire the next generation of Africans to build with blockchain and be an integral part of the community. The team includes graphic novelist and storyteller Chief Nyamweya of Kenya, and blockchain educator and investor, Anne Connelly of Canada. We will distribute an open-access, mobile-first digital version through key partnerships with tech and education networks. Our goal is to reach over 1 million African youth. Progress To date, we have mapped out the characters and storyline for the 120 page book, completed the first chapter, and secured a publisher. We have begun making key partnerships in the space.

Distribution Support - In order to achieve our goal of reaching 1 million kids, we need support to distribute and promote the free digital book across as many networks as possible.

Building a more modular moloch that balances extensibility with a simplistic core that’s easy for devs to customize and build upon. Moloch v3 - The Modular Moloch
Screen Shot 2020-09-16 at 1.07.06 PM877×437 129 KB Moloch v1 was a simple, MVD for permissioned, grant-making communities. Moloch v2 emerged as a more flexible, but still relatively simple DAO framework that works especially well for grant-giving and venture investment. The recent v2x expanded Molochs to work better with tokenized communities and allow for features like having multiple summoners. Unfortunately, we’ve realized that we’ve reached the outer bounds of the Moloch’s capabilities using the current architecture. In order to create a more extensible, modular moloch that can meet the growing demand for simple, yet customizable DAO’s, the community is coming together to build v3 that will use the more modular architecture outlined above. The v3 will still have a few core modules to manage the basics of a DAO to keep things simple. But this new architecture will also allow for these core modules to be extended and updated by “adapters” in order to meet the needs of a particular community. We believe this new approach achieves an optimal balance between simplicity and modularity. Progress
We have already outline the architecture, core modules, and features, and have begun working on building the solidity code and tests to for the core modules and features. You can track our progress here: https://github.com/Moloch-Mystics/moloch-v3. Ask We’re asking for $5K to pay for mini-audits and overhead during this initial phase of development. With this grant we hope to have well-tested core modules and a few common, adapters built and also tested.

TREE will also double as the governance token for a DAO that decides how to distribute funds in the charity pool. At any point, users can also exit by burning their TREEs for a proportion of the reserve. The proportion is given to be the square of one’s share of the supply, to incentivize long-term holding. We’ve already got the contracts up here, and we’re currently working on write-ups, as well as the front-end to allow for the initial distribution (which will be farming based) and the burning portal.

This is the opening program of our “One Million DAO in China” program. It has many meanings: Social value
In China, both office workers and entrepreneurs have been devastated by traditional corporate structures (see the detail in the proposal document). DAO is a solution, but few people know it. The purpose of HackDAO is to help more Chinese know and understand DAO, and try to use DAO. HackDAO is the beginning of the “One Million DAO in China” plan. We will promote the development of DAO in China based on HackDAO and let DAO to create more social value. Ethereum ecosystem development
The Ethereum ecosystem needs more participants, especially non-technical people. DAO is an important bridge for Ethereum to enter these social groups. The participation of these social groups will accelerate the development and prosperity of the Ethereum ecosystem. Proposal doc:

My project Shenanigan is growing everyday. We’ve gotten lots of positive feedback from the Ethereum community and we recently open sourced 50% of our codebase. In fact you can watch us as we develop our contracts from the discord. Shenanigan aims to solve the problem every athlete faces during their career. “If I cant go professional, what do I do when I’m done?” Besides joining a circus? Nothing. Every year, thousands of young adults turn away from there passions and start remedial jobs. And this is our core demographic at Shenanigan. Betting on sporting events is a human pastime as old as history. That’s why last year, Nevada handled $8billion in bets and brought in $543million in revenue. All this money going back and forth and the athletes never see a dime.  Shenanigan wants to open the door to a new paradigm. Shenanigan wants to remove the middleman and pay the athletes directly with a cut of the winnings.Utilizing LivePeer’s streaming technology and the Shenanigan mobile app, athletes will set up a live wager for the app community. Athletes will set their own goals or challenges and then livestream their attempts. If they complete their goal, live for everyone to see, they receive a cut of the betting pot. Winning bets are then paid out accordingly. And Everyone’s Happy! (except the losers) We recently introduced the idea to our first target audience, the Super Smash Bros. Melee Community. While Shenanigan primary focus is outside of Esports, melee players have shown a genuine interest in the product. Of the 400 players/watchers surveyed, 40% said they currently side bet on matches, 56.8% said they would participate in a betting pool, and 92% said they are positive or neutral about betting within the community. We had the #11 player in the world S2J (66K followers) retweet us and sing positive praises as well as the #8 player Plup sing our praises on his stream (clip in the google doc). Shenanigan has been under development for a year before our official presentation in the beginning of 2020. While we plan to release a beta by the end of the year, a Frankenstein MVP has already been put together. The MVP includes: This was a proof of concept more than else, but it gave me a great scope on the project and its requirements.

This proposal was spun up last week and discussed on the weekly call, currently it looks like it’s not going to pass, more due to the time restriction and centralization risk, as opposed to a disagreement with the plan of treasury management. At the same time Moloch v2 is now alive in the world! If we were using a v2 DAO for MetaCartel, these questions about treasury management, centralization, etc, would all be instantly solved by the features v2 allows. Moloch v2 is also still in its infancy, with just a handful of DAOs, it makes sense to start to utilize these new features and to battle-test Moloch v2! So! This proposal outlines similar goals as Peters previous proposal, with more structure and a part migration to v2. With the end outcome being some % of our total DAO bank, held in token sets, inside of a Moloch v2. Process would be as follows: (very open to input here, especially from team Odyssy and more technical folks) We would then have ~75% of our ETH inside of the v1 DAO and ~25% of our ETH inside of the v2 DAO, meaning we’d then have two DAOs – One to test v2 and be the provide funding to initiatives and the other to hold our long-term ETH (v1). Hopefully this all makes sense as a plan, it would be good to talk through it on the weekly call, plus have any/all thoughts thrown on this post. Basically, this proposal: Keen on feedback! If the above makes sense, happy to start the process ","[(<p>All for migrating to a MetaCartel V2! Biggest questions for me:</p>, 'coopahtroopa'), (<p>Feels like a solid plan.

A recent study from The Cremation Institute of 1,150 participants conducted between October 20, 2019, and June 3, 2020, shows that 89% of crypto asset investors worry about losing their assets but only 23% of people have a plan. Alfred is a cryptocurrency estate planner on a mission to make decentralized technologies more accessible by creating tools and protocols to help reduce the likelihood of people losing their digital assets. We’re developing a cryptocurrency inheritance solution using our protocol for Perpetual Inheritance. Perpetual Inheritance gives digital wallet holders the ability to force themselves to prove they can access their primary wallet at regular intervals. The cryptocurrency inheritance solution will walk people through the process of creating a “crypto will” for a digital wallet. It then waits for input from a dead man’s switch or an official database for collecting death records to generate Proof-of-Incapacitation (decentralized) or Proof-of-Death (centralized). Once a death has been reported, the dApp provides flows for confirming and contesting the death. If a death is confirmed, it will then allow an executor to close lending positions, divert funds, etc. if given permission to do so and distribute the assets to beneficiaries in accordance with the user’s final wishes. In other words, we’ve created a method for recovering digital assets that can be centralized and automated for convenience or decentralized to provide censorship-resistance and preserve anonymity.

Perpetual Inheritance
Project Plan The question of what happens if a DAO member dies or becomes incapacitated needs to be addressed in order to support the future expansion of DAOs. We believe the solution lies in Perpetual Inheritance and are looking for support to develop the integrations necessary to make DAOs and cryptocurrency safer and more accessible. Ken Hodler is a senior engineer, formerly CTO and an early contributor at Keepkey (exited to ShapeShift). Morgan Sherwood is a dApp engineer with 25+ year career as a Python developer and algorithmic trader skilled in smart contract security analysis. Aaron Anderson brings dApps to market as a dApp engineer and cofounder of Web3Devs and Ching! Seth Goldfarb is a marketing professional with 4+ years of experience helping businesses make blockchain and its applications more accessible to their stakeholders. The team began exploring this problem at ETHDenver 2020 and continued our work through the MetaCartel Dragon Quest, securing bounties from Kyber and Gnosis and winning 2nd Prize overall in the Dragon Quest along the way. We are incorporated as a Wyoming-based LLC and operate using an Aragon DAO under a framework developed by Etherize. Our current plan is to release an unaudited, cleaned-up version of our Dragon Quest hackathon project as a beta of the cryptocurrency inheritance solution in the coming weeks, seek feedback and undergo a security audit, and have a full launch in Q4 2020. We’re seeking the maximum grant of $8000 to help cover the $13,000 estimated cost we’ve been quoted for a smart contract audit from Consensys or Quantstamp.","[(<p>This is certainly a grat and relevant theme, but I think there were previous efforts in the same direction and I expected to see a review of such efforts and why this represents a better option.<br/>

68,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/dao-proposal-umbra-stealth-payments/737,DAO Proposal: Umbra Stealth Payments - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,coopahtroopa," Note: This proposal is made on behalf of the Umbra team - Ben Difrancesco & Matt Solomon Umbra is a protocol for enabling stealth payments on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables privacy preserving transactions where the receiver’s identity is only known to the sender and receiver. Umbra is meant for payments between two entities, and comes with a different set of privacy tradeoffs than mixer solutions. Rather than breaking the link between sending and receiving address, Umbra makes that link meaningless. Everyone knows the address funds were sent to, but they don’t know who controls that address. This means Umbra… A proof of concept MVP was built for the HackMoney hackathon. It was among the Hackathon’s finalists and won prizes from ENS and OpenGSN. You can watch our submission demo. You can also view our presentation at the HackMoney finale and watch the judge’s feedback, including Vitalik Buterin & Andreas Antonopoulos. You can also try it out on Ropsten at https://ropsten.umbra.cash. Our goal is to get to mainnet in Fall 2020. To do so, we’ll: $3,000 in DAI to pay for Consensys Dilligence’s one day security review program. The Consensys Diligence team offers a 12 hour security review for $3,000. While this is not a full audit by any stretch, it can help surface large architectural issues early, and provide direction for avoiding pitfalls now that would be more costly to address later. Additionally, Diligence will deduct the $3,000 cost of this review from the cost of a full security audit, so this will also help make the full security audit more affordable. This audit also plays into MetaCartel’s ongoing relationship with the Consensys Diligence team. For more information, and to see our code, checkout the GitHub repository at https://github.com/ScopeLift/umbra-protocol As ecosystem actors frequently working and collecting payment in crypto, we feel that Umbra is a perfect solution for anyone who wants to continue receiving ETH, DAI, etc. without having to reveal their identity - something which also allows anyone to backtrack and reverse engineer where different payments came from (and who you worked with). While there are convoluted ways of working around this, we believe Umbra is a much more intuitive solution. In exchange for this grant we’d like to invite members of MetaCartel to partner with us for our soft launch - being amongst the first to access and use the product before it is announced to the public.","[(<p>Thanks for posting <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/coopahtroopa"">@coopahtroopa</a>.

70,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/daohaus-sustainability/746,DAOhaus Sustainability - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,vengist," DAOhaus as example of a sustainable, open-source DAO Overview DAOhaus stands on the shoulders of Molochian giants. What started as a single DAO interface for MetaCartel’s original Moloch clone has grown into an open-source ecosystem. DAOhaus offers a no-code platform for launching Moloch DAOs with value-added features such as custom themes, advanced Minion interoperability, and many others “Boosts”. Sustainability In order for the product to keep pace with user demand, a runway is required to seed real-time value creation. Users need features. Product needs capital to build those features. Investors need ROI on seed capital. These features - called Boosts - will be monetized and shared with a DAO focused on injecting maximum value creation into the product for its users. What emerges is a feedback loop in which there are no dictators, with upside shared proportionally among all participants in an ownership economy. Benefits of this Grant Through this collaborative effort, we will solidify a simple path for open-source projects to DAOify and become sustainable. This grant will give us the capital needed to document and kickstart our Initial DAO Offering (IDO), sharing insights with MetaCartel members and Dapps to come. Progress + Next Steps: Every Monday for the past 5 weeks, key contributors (listed below) have come together for War Camp workshops to iterate on and finalize the framework for the DAOhaus IDO. This has lead to: With this grant, the key team will prioritize the completion and deployment of key elements including but not limited to: Who’s Building It? Underpinning the War Camp are a suite of MetaCartel all-stars including but not limited to: Funds Requested DAOhaus is requesting 10,000 DAI to be allocated among key contributors to seed the execution of the DAOhaus IDO. In return, DAOhaus will output a detailed reflection to MetaCartel members gleaning insights from this process along with exploring the capacity for DAOs like MetatCartel to earn HAUS for their role in influencing this project. Closing Thoughts The premise of creating a cyclical economy in which the users of DAOs capture upside in the platform they use is one of the key elements of what makes web 3 products so powerful. DAOhaus seeks to always be driven by the community with open-sourced sustainability at heart. We invite any and all those keen to contribute to join the Discord as we shape the future of DAOs through the first of an entirely new wave of grassroots product creation.

Why are we building Upala: Upala provides a digital identity uniqueness score. The score is valued in dollars. It represents the explosion price - an amount of money that an identity holder can get at any time for deleting their ID. The higher the explosion price the higher the owner values the ID and the safer it is for DApps to interact with. The building block of Upala is a group (consisting of people or other groups). The explosions payouts are provided by group pools. Thus groups tend to consist of people (groups) who believe that other members value their IDs equally. Groups may earn from user deposits and/or by providing user scores to dapps for a fee. This incentivizes groups to gather as many users as possible. Users are incentivized to choose groups assigning the highest scores. At the same time the higher the score (i.e. the explosion price), the higher is the incentive to forge an identity. The market drives these prices to the equilibrium for every user - much in the same way as insurance rates work. Upala is a protocol. It allows different identity systems to be built and united under the same scoring standard. The protocol can wrap over existing systems (Bright ID, Idena, etc.) and unite them. The purpose of this grant is to build the BladerunnerDAO​:zap: - the minimal viable identity system on top of Upala. BladeRunnerDAO​:zap: will use membership in existing DAOs as an entry test (proof-of-human) and auto-assign scores to the members. It will also provide functionality to add other DAOs and other types of entry-tests. Probably it will even grow organically to manage Upala itself.

Funding request: $6000 Upala has several options for generating profit. The actions that we can make payable are: But before that we have to overcome the adoption gap. There is a lot of work ahead and there is no way we can do it with a single grant. So here is how we plan to sustain development after this grant’s money runs out: A reliable anti-sybil system is crucial for projects dealing with voting, UBI, advertisement, loans, etc. Solving the unique human problem will bring a variety of new usecases for Ethereum and will boost adoption in the long run.

 Aim of the mission: Share our work on DAOs and bring them to other non-crypto communities. Show how they are able to potentially self-coordinate and allocate funding towards their own causes. Forge relationships with DAO-curious community builders and ultimately build bridges between MetaCartel with relevantly aligned communities outside of crypto. Nature of the mission: User research, diplomacy Activities: Outcomes: Who? Timeline:
Approximately 1 month ~ Ask:
3000 USD + other potential expenses eg. podcast editing We re-discovered the ‘meta’ religion of the community first ethos via DAOs and are missionaries that look to share this with the rest of the world around us. (should be reasonably competent for this mission) We have built a MetaCity of various projects, DAOs and other communities in crypto. The next step is to establish MetaCartel as a digital nation-state that acts as a connector, aggregator, and portal to other missions’ first, values-driven communities. MetaCartel’s strength is in its ability to become an effective social ‘meta’ community layer (trust-based community network). Think of MetaCartel DAO as the airport to the rest of the MetaUniverse of projects and communities.

THX allows you to pool funds and create rules to reward people. It is designed to give incentives to members of online communities, for example for organizing an event or contributing code. A fair distribution of rewards is governed by communal voting, effectively turning apps into simple DAOs. Our aim is to integrate with established software, adding value to an existing user base. One could say it is an enhancing business model, instead of a disruptive one. Current integrations; The THX token is both an utility and governance token. It allows you to setup reward pools and in the future will earn reward fees. End users of communities do not have to hold the token to participate in reward pools, we expect most people to transact in ERC-20 stablecoins like DAI and USDC or in future versions with community specific or even non-fungible tokens. You can schedule a demo with me and read more about the latest version here. Team 
We have a distributed five person team working from The Netherlands and Germany. We share a passion for open source, UX and blockchain technology. For more background on our team members check out our intro and pitch deck; https://thx.page.link/intro (PDF) EU Horizon 2020 grant 
Our project has been awarded funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme as part of the sub-grant agreement no. 828888 (Blockpool.eu, see assessment) Roadmap and funding goals 
Up till now we have been bootstrapping with our own time and money, next to jobs that pay the bills. The full eight month roadmap includes privacy assessments (GDPR) and security audits leading to release on mainnet. We have to add fulltime engineering resources to accomplish this. The total funding needed is €235k. Approximately €30k is covered by the Blockpool grant, most of which will be paid upon completion of the planned milestones at the end of 2020. DAO and other models ‍:balance_scale:
Back in 2018 we programmed a DAICO to launch the THX token. We liked the idea of a project tap instead of a lump sum ICO and also that the contract could be resolved with funds remaining being distributed back to contributors. The code is still available on our github. In the end we abandoned these efforts due to regulatory issues and difficulties establishing a banking relationship in The Netherlands. Now, we’re considering multiple options for issuance with a preference for a DAO on Aragon, but also an airdrop or direct sales to launching customers. Our main consideration for a DAO would be to govern things like the reward fee and development funds and perhaps, in time, decentralize the protocol further by moving from a centralized administrative key towards a time enforced community managed address. This would likely also involve setting up a foundation next to the commercial entity that is maintaining the API which however centralized, eases integration immensely.

80,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/dao-proposal-savedai-1-0/649,DAO Proposal: saveDAI 1.0 - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,spengrah," saveDAI aims to be the easiest way to open a high-interest, insured savings account. The idea for saveDAI dates back to late summer 2019 when I realized that I wanted to see a tokenized version of Nexus Mutual contract cover for cDAI (“nmcDAI”). However, it soon became clear that the architecture of Nexus Mutual did not lend itself to tokenization. Fast forward to when Opyn protocol launched tokenized option-based insurance for cDAI and cUSDC just before ETHDenver, and I changed my planned hackathon project to what would become saveDAI. Our team is Kseniya (a member of Meta Delta Gamma), Doug, and me (Spencer). So what is saveDAI? Well, it’s two things: A smart contract that wraps together an equivalent amount of cDAI and ocDAI to create what we call a “self-insured asset”. The contract has functionality to wrap, unwrap, and submit an insurance claim (i.e. exercise the ocDAI for immediate payout). The contract will be open-source and available as an on-chain primitive for others to build on or integrate with. For example, protocols that automatically deposit DAI held in their contracts into Compound could instead deposit DAI into saveDAI to easily insure their assets. This proposal is for saveDAI 1.0. See below for a potential 2.0 direction. A user-facing dapp powered by the contract that makes it super simple for users (we call them “savers”) to open a savings account. saveDAI is almost entirely a user experience project. It’s already possible to acquire both cDAI and ocDAI, but the multiple steps involved limits the number of people who have done so thus far. There are fewer than 50 addresses with ocDAI balances today. We believe that by removing a significant portion of the friction involved, we can attract more savers to protect their savings. More savers protecting their savings benefits multiple parties: In fact, we also believe that saveDAI could help onboard more muggles into crypto by creating an easy way for them to open a savings account that closely mirrors their traditional account (deposit insurance is the key), but with higher interest and without the various hassles of dealing with a bank. To this end, in addition to the natural UX improvements that the saveDAI contract achieves, we also plan to incorporate gas payment and fiat-onboarding tools — e.g. from Authereum and Wyre — into the subsequent iterations of the product. saveDAI is primarily a UX project, but, for obvious reasons, saveDAI makes no sense unless it can properly protect our users’ funds. Therefore, while the saveDAI contract limits bug/attack surface area by creating minimal net new functionality — instead bundling together and exposing the functionality already built by other projects — it is imperative that the contract code be professionally audited. This proposal’s primary ask is for funds to pay for an audit. Since the saveDAI contract draws nearly all of its functionality from existing protocols like Compound, Opyn, MakerDAO, and Uniswap (hooray money legos! ) and does not generate a first-order (e.g. liquidity) network effect, it does not have a defensible business model of its own. For example, forking the contract would be trivial and would not diminish its utility at all. Similarly, while a well-built user-facing product could garner a significant user-base, any revenue opportunity would need to be based on up-sell or add-on features, and a number of well-built products and well-funded companies already exist that could likely adopt saveDAI-like capabilities (or, frankly, saveDAI itself) relatively easily — think Instadapp, Zerion, Argent, Dharma, and the like. Therefore, we view saveDAI as a free and open-source public good. Read more here: saveDAI is currently a side-project for everybody on the team. Here is what we have accomplished to date: We are aiming to release saveDAI 1.0 in June 2020, though the timing of our launch may change depending on the interest rate environment. Options-based insurance from Opyn has several properties that make saveDAI possible: However, the current version of ocDAI is just that — a current version. The insurance it provides expires when the option series expires on February 10, 2021. After that date, saveDAI will need to transition to the next option series. Moreover, we anticipate a proliferation of variations of ocDAI (differing on strike price as well as expiry date), and there are already different assets covered in addition to cDAI, like cUSDC and iearn tokens. That presents a challenge for saveDAI, since new contracts will need to be developed and deployed to handle the transition to new terms or cover additional insurance variations. But it also presents an opportunity: what if there were an easy way to create a new token for any asset:insurance combination you needed? We envision a self-insured asset factory that allows anybody to create new tokenized bundles of a given asset together with its insurance. Such a factory would enable the saveDAI dapp to… Eventually, if a tokenized insurance standard is adopted, the factory could even support other types of insurance in addition to Opyn options. Thus far, other than the time we have put into the project, we have spent only a total of $11.18 on saveDAI — $1.18 for the savedai.xyz domain name and 10 DAI on the savedai Everest listing. This proposal for saveDAI 1.0 asks for $7,750, which will be used in the following fashion: If the user-facing dapp achieves sufficient traction, we may submit a follow-up proposal to develop the 2.0 contract(s) required to expand to additional savings assets.","[(<p><a class=""mention"" href=""/u/alexmasmej"">@AlexMasmej</a> Im sure you’d be interested in this one.</p>, 'OKDuncan'), (<p>Apologise but we are completely shifting MetaCartel’s progress at the moment and would likely say that we would not be further supporting/providing grants funding to projects of this area (DeFi)</p>, 'pet3rpan'), (<p><a class=""mention"" href=""/u/okduncan"">@OKDuncan</a> yes I have been in touch with the team and think this is honestly brilliant.

81,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/dao-proposal-timerex-dapp/455,DAO Proposal: TimeRex dapp - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,joseph," This proposal outlines the dapp idea timeRex  based on the experiments I’ve been working on for representing an hour of time as a token. Recently there have been several experiments with using tokens to represent individuals’ time. I’ve been selling tokens that represent 1 hour of development work from me, since last year. I think this is a great way to get people using their crypto and new people to ecosystem to understand that tokens and cryptocurrencies have value because they understand that their time intrinsically has value. I’m also interested in creating more ways for people to earn their first crypto, and see easy ways to do so as the best onboarding processes. Supporting development of this project will result in a dapp which has: One step towards building better DAOs is tokenizing our time and building markets where people are paid more fairly by tokenizing individuals’ labour. There are lots of great projects out there working to build the DAOs of the future. But the DAOs will need to access & hire lots of different types of people. Developers, Marketers, Copy Writers, Researchers, etc… The best way to pay those workers instantly, and tie their work directly to a market governed by supply and demand, is to tokenize workers’ time. This way their pay rate is fairly set by the market, developers and marketers can auto-magically swap services, and DAOs can purchase a number of hours in advanced. This will hopefully result in some interesting things like: It will be easier for DAOs to track and use human capital when it is tokenized. Also it could be a fun way to onboard people and make it easier for individuals new to crypto to earn their first ETH! Instead of stealing a percentage of tokens like token launching platforms usually do. I would rather just do it for free and charge for some kind of badges that you can give people you work with or trust (see Gitcoin Kudos). No marketplace for different tokens because moderating it seems like a horrible job. But perhaps companies or organizations can sponsor job postings here. A $2000 grant and a request that everyone tokenize an hour of their time once it launches.

We wanted to bring the community up to date with the work that’s happening here as we believe it’s got great potential as a future sustainability method for MetaCartel. Improving the overall on-boarding of using Loft.Radio by integrating Abridged contract wallets instead of MetaMask. Artists will only need to login to Telegram and use their @handle / email that has an associated ETH address. Listeners will be able to tip and listen inside Telegram using only their @handle and the associated ETH address, new users can buy ETH/DAi using Wyre with CC inside MetaFuel. Using 3Frame we are able to create a Loft.Radio integration within MetaFuel. However, since this is the first 3Frame integration there will be unknown unknowns and edge cases to tackle. Furthermore, we could create Artist and User on-boarding flows, that would eventually be generalized inside of MetaFuel. Start designing a repeatable process for onboarding applications into MetaFuel. Currently we have tipping working inside of iframe and Telefuel has integrated the iframe into MetaFuel. Would love feedback on thoughts on this, here and also coordinating the actual development inside RaidGuild Discord Channel name #Raid-metaloftradio","[(<p>This is great!

MetaClan was originally pitched to me by Peter and is led by myself and James Waugh from MetaCartel along with Alex “SillyTuna” Amsel and Piers Kicks - two individuals with strong ties in the wider gaming community and years of experience in competitive gaming. We’ve received strong feedback with over 100 members on Telegram, 60 members in Discord and ~250 followers on Twitter. More importantly, we’ve received verbal support from major gaming studios included but not limited to Skymavis (Axie Infinity) Blockade Games (Neon District) and The Sandbox Game - all of which are keen on us to knock this out of the park. For those eager to learn more, here are our first two articles to provide more detail on what MetaClan is and how it’s being structured. Introducing MetaClan (primer) Prepare for Takeoff (roles, first commander + original quest) TLDR: MetaClan will be summoned as a MolochV2 in the coming weeks in tandem with the launch of our first quest - an Axie Infinity Breeding Tournament. Our Ask: We are seeking 30 shares (~$3000 plus a small amount of buffer for ETH volatility) in grant funding to seed the DAO for both our first inaugural quest and a suite of future quests. This grant will be split in half as follows: Please note that unlike other grants, it’s difficult to quantity a milestone for incubating a digital community - specifically one with as many angles as “crypto-gaming”. To this, I would suggest that successfully executing on the first quest and having X players pledged to the DAO is a milestone in and of itself. If you have ideas on what a better milestone or metric might be we’re happy to hear it! Details about the breeding tournament economics can be found here. All feedback is encouraged and welcomed! Address to receive shares: 0x5B93FF82faaF241c15997ea3975419DDDd8362c5 Our Mission: Progress: Deliverables: Use of Funds: To date, MetaClan has been seeded out of pocket including: Our immediate future costs: Future Funds: Additional Information: Closing Thoughts There is a non-zero chance that a crypto-game will go viral. We seek to be on the forefront of these games and create the leading teams for competitive and social cooperation. More so than winning every tournament, the bigger value add here is that of community.

87,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/dao-proposal-loft-radio/499,DAO Proposal: Loft Radio 🎧 - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,jzstern," Sup MetaCartel! A few months ago my friend Michael and I launched Loft –– a free, 24/7 radio where listeners can tip artists directly in ETH while their music is playing. We’re live now at https://loft.radio. You may have seen our ETH Denver project (Bound), another project focused on helping artists make money doing what they love. We both produce music, make web apps, and are passionate about exploring new ways of supporting creators online using crypto. Loft was made to explore new ways of exchanging value between listeners and artists. We’re creating experimental listening spaces centered around supporting creators directly. Loft empowers listeners to support the work they enjoy, and artists to collect money themselves for their creations. On Loft, artists receive 100% of every tip directly into their Ethereum wallet. We’d eventually like to have stations for: To support something like personal stations, we need to move away from our current broadcasting service, Radio.co. We’d like to create a custom solution to broadcast live audio in a decentralized way. We’re considering building of building on top of the Audius protocol, and think this could be beneficial to both the music industry and web3 ecosystem. We’re also exploring other ideas around tipping including “streaming"" money, tips that earn interest, and “investing” in songs/artists. Ethereum opens up endless opportunities to support creators in new ways monetarily. Loft will become a novel destination for listening to, discovering, collecting, and sharing music online, all while supporting the artists who make it. We offer an alternative revenue stream for digital music and radio. Listeners can tip artists directly in ETH, and artists receive 100% of every tip. Loft does not take a cut, and we’ll continue to introduce new incentives for listeners to tip. We support artists with promotion and exposure by providing a platform to showcase their music. While an artist’s music is playing, we link to their SoundCloud, Spotify, or any other URL. Upon acceptance, we promote them on socials and debut their music at a specific time for 7 days. We invite and embrace community feedback. We aim to involve artists more directly in the evolution of Loft. Their feedback guides the future of a small project that embraces technology, values transparency, and believes in fairness for creators. We love the amazing community and collaborative energy that is MetaCartel. With the help of your guidance and support, we hope to grow our community of listeners, artists, and labels tenfold, drive more exposure and revenue to artists, and fulfill the vision of Loft. So far we’ve spent $420 on the project (no joke). We’re asking for a grant of $1000, which would allow us to focus significantly more time on Loft. The funds would go to:  Development time (view our priorities here)  Radio.co subscription  G Suite subscription  Commissioning art We’re exploring options for becoming self sustaining and profitable, but our number one priority right now is to create a product that brings value to artists.","[(<p>Awesome project!

I am very new to knowing such communities exist and I am quickly learning what they are all about, so far I’m a big fan of what you all do. In light of the current situation the world is faced with, I am requesting a small grant to pursue the  MetaSpace experiment. MetaSpace is a starting point for what could turn into a hub for Web3 wellness. It would house meditation, breathing exercises, yoga/movement, discussions and learning experiences for people to utilize no matter where in the world they are. Every experience would be specifically targeted to Web3 communities hosted via live stream. Each person can participate from the comfort of their own space and be anonymous if they choose. This creates a low risk, safe container for people to release, explore and learn while receiving guidance from a wellness professional. By providing the tools of yoga, movement, mediation and discussion, we can shift people’s energy and collectively propel communities forward. Phase 1 of MetaSpace will be five weeks of live streams targeted at bringing Web3 communities together with two sessions happening per week. Each session could include 30-45 minutes of movement, 15-30 minutes and breathing and meditation, and 15-30 minutes of discussion on a specific topic such as: focus, mindfulness, empathy, creativity, etc. I will look to the community of MetaCartel for what they would like to discuss so these events can be catered to the needs of your community. These sessions could be live streamed using interspace.metagame.wtf or zoom, and are intended to help individuals collectively foster balance and peace so that each person can find clarity and feel grounded in their work and their personal lives. In my mind, community is what it’s all about. How can we as a community support each other, take care of each other, foster each other’s growth so that we can continue the natural cycle of evolution on a personal level and collective level? I want this* to be a community funded project that is for the community that it serves. In this way there is an exchange of energy between the two. In the future, if this initiative does well, I would like to expand this project- reaching out to more organizations, bringing more people in from my field and expanding the global reach with the intention of making it a fully sustainable project. What I am asking from MetaCartel is a grant for $1000 and feedback about the sessions. What is working, what do you want more of, is this serving you? I’d also be glad to have help with things like graphic design, developing a project road-map, and the user experience.

I see this iteration of the Sports DAO as a way to bridge the intense engagement of sports fans in blogs, twitter, etc., and an actual ownership of teams.

DAOresear.ch  DAOresearch is a research lab aggregating news and insights related to DAOs. Our goal is to help people understand, create, and join DAOs. To start we find awesome DAO stuff and shill it out on the DAOresearch Twitter . Then we aggregate that information into a  Weekly Newsletter . Then we compile relevant information into a Research Library  with information on DAOs in the Wild   as well as DAO Related Things  such as tokeneconomics, governance, and community building. As the space evolves we will create opinionated content (via our blog and newsletter) providing a perspective on the DAO news of the day. As we learn what works and what doesn’t we will create content explaining the models that are thriving, how they operate, and how to get involved. We’re reaching out to MetaCartel because you guys are awesome. We want to be part of the community. More concretely, we would like to make DAOresearch into a living library that people who are interested in DAO related research can contribute to and engage with. What better to do this than by joining the most awesome community driven DAO of them all? We are requesting 10 shares to join the MetaCartel. This will allow us to better understand how MetaCartel operates and what makes it different. We will then use that knowledge to improve the MetaCartel  DAO page. This will include highlighting how MetaCartel as a DAO operates, how people can get involved, and how others might follow the MetaCartel model to launch communities of their own. Where this information exists we will document it and make it as accessible as possible. When needed, we will also work with MetaCartel to create new content. In short, our goal is to help people build and join awesome DAOs. Currently, this is difficult because the space is exploding with opportunities and it’s hard to know where to start. We are creating a 1-stop shop to help people learn about, join, and build DAOs. MetaCartel is an awesome DAO and we’d like to join you and receive your support in order to help more people build more awesome DAOs.","[(<p>Big fan of this intiative, I would love to see DAOresear.ch come under the Cartel wings <img alt="":eagle:"" class=""emoji"" src=""https://forum.metacartel.org/images/emoji/twitter/eagle.png?v=9"" title="":eagle:""/></p>, 'Yalor'), (<p>+1 love to see information + DAO experimentation</p>, 'pet3rpan'), (<p>Proposal on-chain <a href=""https://pokemol.com/dao/0x0372f3696fa7dc99801f435fd6737e57818239f2/proposal/107"">https://pokemol.com/dao/0x0372f3696fa7dc99801f435fd6737e57818239f2/proposal/107</a></p>, 'Yalor')]",2020-03-27T00:46:11Z

98,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/dao-proposal-defizap/384,DAO proposal: DeFiZap - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,Nodar," Hello MetaCartel! I’m currently working on DeFiZap: a system of smart contracts - Zaps - that deploys ETH (and soon DAI) across multiple DeFi protocols in one transaction. Get instant access to interesting opportunities in DeFi:
Lending
Pooling
Staking
Leveraged Liquidity Pooling and more coming soon as we keep observing the space and remixing new use cases while keeping education at the core of our approach. DeFiZap doesn’t spread ETH across ‘top 10 on coinmarketcap’ - Zaps inject ETH into financial protocols built on top of Ethereum, furthering user adoption.
and more coming as we keep observing the space and remixing new use cases while keeping education at the core of our approach. Everything we’ve done so far has been purely based on constant user feedback and iterations. We’ve integrated ENS capabilities to allow users to access DeFi opportunities simply by sending ETH to human-readable addresses directly from their Ethereum wallet. Just input an address like “MKRUnipool.DeFiZap.eth”, tweak the gas limit to 1,500,000 and boom! You’re now MKR/ETH Pool Liquidity Provider on Uniswap. In the future, we plan on further enhancing on-boarding experiences with a number of Venmo-like tools to make the process as friendly & digestible as possible.  August 1st: First tutorial published on DeFiTutorials.com - currently 500+ active readers. September 18th: After getting some feedback, built DeFiStrategies.com educational simulator mvp with no code in a weekend. 80+ Early user surveys collected. October 8: After some more feedback, formulated idea around DeFiZap. Saw Kyber’s hackathon happening around that time. Reached out on Kyber Discord looking for help. Started working with Dipesh + Tosh. October 26: First Zap (Lender) deployed on the mainnet. November 12: DeFiZap Wins #KyberDeFi Hackathon. December 9: Observing a paintpoint some users experience when interacting with Uniswap Pools we created Unipool Zaps. These Zaps caught the most traction so far. Received a big shoutout from Uniswap. Suhail from DaiEmbassy joined us. Current available Zaps and stats on how much ETH was deployed into DeFi through Zaps. Q1 we are going to focus on integrations as we received a lot of interest, experiment with some revenue generation models. First and foremost we would love your guidance as our goal is to always keep education at the core of our approach, we want top quality investment advice. Need some funds to help us get to sustainability in Q1. Initial $4,000 grant ask, split into two tranches (first received now and another received after milestone 1) as we build a sustainable business in Q1. We’ve been running lean, just our bills + SC audit + legal. Milestone 1: $1,000 generated from fees (Kyber + activity from upcoming integrations). We want to be aligned with industry’s best talent & partners and hopefully can rely on their relationships to introduce us to investors who share a similar vision.","[(<p>First, thank you for putting together so many awesome DeFi resources and tools <img alt="":books:"" class=""emoji"" src=""https://forum.metacartel.org/images/emoji/twitter/books.png?v=9"" title="":books:""/></p>, 'burrrata')]",2019-12-25T09:39:13Z
99,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/dao-proposal-unijocks-and-other-such-limited-edition-creative-works/521,DAO Proposal: Unijocks and other such limited edition creative works - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,unijocks," Unijocks proposal for grant funding. What are we building? The first marketplace for limited edition creative work that, by design, allows talent to rise to the top. The works are represented as tokens with limited supply and a fixed price however we integrate with uniswap to raise or lower the price depending upon demand ensuring that everything sells within the crowdsale period. The track record of each creative’s success is tied to their address. Savvy buyers can identify talent amidst the crowds (as their popularity and sales results increase disproportionately) by using tools that track on chain records. In this way genuine creative talent is promoted autonomously through the market’s web 3 payment mechanism rather than reviews or advertising like in web 2. POS (Proof of shipping) Here’s our testnet MVP video pushing tokens to Uniswap (the password is tokenn). This is a different usecase for this functionality than described here.
We are a team of three. Me (UK/Ireland based) and two solidity devs, Natalia and Bogdan based in Ukraine. We have worked together since early 2017 building DAOs and dApps. What is the solution? Having already integrated with Uniswap we had an idea: we could create a limited edition works revolution by making the token issuing contract create an initial market by pushing tokens and ETH to Uniswap BUT THEN depending on how the sale of the limited edition goods is going it continues to either send more liquidity, supply or withdraws tokens from Uniswap. This does three things: Why here? Honestly, we feel like we could build this and launch it and no one would notice (boo hoo). No “ex-coinbase” story here, nor influencers to shill the project. This is a  “go fast go alone go far go together” moment. WTH does this idea come from? I’ve been thinking about such things for a looong time; I bought fashionrep.com in 2009 after a stint at Parsons fash school with a view to disrupting talent’s route to success. Watched possible tech implementations come and go.  At various points considered launching a startup but the technical solution always missed a wow factor. Now having been buidling on ethereum for 4 years it is time. Probably wont use fashionrep but just highlighting how long I’ve been looking at this particular problem. Last year considered launching Unijocks using the solution described above. I even made an actually pair of jocks with the uniswap logo for fun, but timing just pulled me back from pushing on with the development. And I was worried about the innovation being a bit lost on a then nascent community. Competition and how are we unique? Interesting to see @ourZora and Fame launch but I think we were actually the first DAO to lunch a Uniswap market over a year ago having been inspired by unisocks. They are first mainnet as recently reported on The Block. Well done! Competition is good. Metafactory’s digiphysical future is also in this space. However, the Unijocks solution differs because its not so Kanye can make more money off people selling limited edition sneakers (rather than others on secondary markets), its so underdog talent can rise up in a meritocracy and savvy shoppers can get the next big thing before it become the next big thing. Its also different than metafactory because our DAO won’t “manage and curate our product marketplace”. The market will decide which talent rises, the DAOs purpose will be curation at the inevitable dick-pick spam level, or where a user tries to game an index such as that described below. Just think about whats possible - we can capture the average sale price to listed token price for each market created for each address (creative person). We can list creatives by growth in this index over time so that shoppers can talent spot and so that talent rises. This is great for artists especially, or NFT creators, but also good for fashion and potentially musicians. Actually, the platform is creative-type agnostic. We see the platforms insta, twitter and facebook accounts being key channels alongside website. Use of funds We are a UK non profit which is a good type of entity to grant fund. All funds will be donated to Natalia and Bogdan for the solidity work. A bit will be needed for design too. We can start right away. If we can light up this space we would love xyz to have first investor dibs on a spin off, and we love crowd equity funding (tokenised if possible).

During this process we realised the subtle changes on how you onboard shareholders and that a dApp would be required to aid this process as using etherscan and one-click-dapp can be cumbersome for even the crypto-natives. We used the new meta-cartel ventures DAO as a testing ground and first MVP of the product. https://github.com/blockrockettech/metacartel-ventures-dapp <<< code https://onboarder.metacartel.org/ <<< first instance DAOs are cool but a little tricky to understand. We want to help with the tooling so the next innovators can quickly spin up dApp and get things moving. This is not a full DAO solution, more an onboarder but we have built in automated processes like ETH to wETH conversion and approvals to make the multi-step process easier to understand the follow.

The purpose of iearn.finance is very simple. Yield aggregator for lending platforms that rebalances for highest yield whenever the contract is interacted with. Full documentation available docs.iearn.finance The system currently supports; Upcoming support for $BAT, $KNC, $LINK, $MKR, $REP, $SNX, $ZRX. The system current aggregates; Busy integrating DDEX and LENDF, trying to do Nuo as well, but the APR is currently difficult to calculate. Competitors? Similar services in this space include staked RAY, idleDAI, topo (not yet launched), and metamarkets (not yet launched). Why build it? The system simplifies the user journey so that the #DeFi investor doesn’t have to worry about the underlying protocols, yield hunting or understanding complex #DeFi strategies. It simplifies complex strategies like being an LP provider to UniswapExchange (via iETH) or depositing DAI into cDAI with swap from cDAI to cUSDC and into CurveFinance, a strategy example docs.iearn.finance When comparing interest, it also considers LP opportunities with the underlying token protocol, so it won’t just compare fulcrum.trade’s iDAI with compound.finance’s cDAI, but also weigh up how much APR is possible by being an LP for ETH/cDAI and adjusts the cDAI performance based on this calculation. What funding do I need? This is a complete #OS, free, 0 fee system. I even encourage people to run their own versions or become a competitor. I just need help with getting audits done as currently it is proving quite expensive given the quotes I have received. Anything else? The system is built out of different mini components (heavily inspired by DeFi_Zap) that are usable and composable on-chain, such as APR aggregators, recommendation decision trees, or just interfaces.

With Telefuel, your Telegram chat experience is more organized, efficient, and powerful. 
1a_Telefuel_Screenshot.jpg1344×732 194 KB
 With the roadmap outlined in this proposal, Telefuel will be building new features that will change the way teams like MetaCartel interact, collaborate, and communicate. Download: https://telefuel.com/downloads Telegram: https://t.me/telefuel Twitter: https://twitter.com/telefuelapp We love Telegram for its security, privacy, community, and features - but the official Telegram apps simply aren’t built for power users and professionals. (If you know, you know.) With Telefuel, users log in with with their existing Telegram account. Telefuel pulls in their existing Telegram chats*, giving each user immediate access to Telefuel’s power features, making their Telegram experience more organized, sane, and productive (see features list below). Already, Telefuel has meaningfully improved the way users from MetaCartel, Abridged, Ethereum Foundation, and others interact on Telegram… and we’re just getting started! *Chats, messages, and media are passed directly from Telegram’s servers to the client, and are never touch/seen/stored on our servers. Learn more about our Security & Data Model here. Telefuel is currently in public beta with ~200 Daily Active Users, including team members from MetaCartel, Abridged, Ethereum Foundation, FTX Exchange, and more. Though still early, Telefuel shows early signs of product-market fit, including strong retention and usage metrics: “I think I would cry if you guys no longer existed.” -Pet3rpan Telefuel is in public beta, and available on web & desktop (Mac, Windows, and Linux). Current Features include: See for yourself! Download Telefuel here. Telefuel is currently limited to “single player” mode, meaning individual Telefuel users can organize their chats into personal workspaces, but there’s currently no way for them to share or invite other users to access these configured workspaces (like Slack or Discord) - a critical feature for Teams and Communities juggling multiple Telegram chats across their organization. With this grant, we will be addressing this shortcoming by building shared workspaces, aka “Telefuel Teams”. With Telefuel Teams, team admins will be able to configure Teams workspaces with official team chats, and invite their team members to access these preconfigured workspace. Telefuel Teams simplifies and streamlines the entire process of onboarding, offboarding, and juggling access permissions for teams and communities on Telegram - bringing all their Team chats, users, and permissions settings into a single Workspace view. Communication and coordination is core to any DAO, and the best DAOs will have the best communication and coordination tools. Because MetaCartel already organizes via Telegram groups, Telefuel Teams will vastly improve the way MetaCartel organizes, communicates, and collaborates. Every user and project involved in MetaCartel stands to benefit from the improved collaboration and organization offered by Telefuel Teams. For this proposal, Telefuel Teams is seeking $10,000 USD in grant funding to oversee the completion of Telefuel Teams. The end deliverable with be a Telefuel Teams product that MetaCartel will have a year of complimentary access to. The expected timeline is 4 weeks from approval date, estimated currently as late-March. This is the first MetaCartel grant working with a crypto adjacent project. If this proposal passes and the TeleFuel teams delivers, the next phase would be to immediately experiment with a chat based dApp browser with built-in wallet functionality.

This grant was originally proposed and approved via soft consensus under MetaCartel’s Cohort I, Wave III as SwagDAO (https://medium.com/metacartel/metacartel-cohort-1-6336cdca05db). All grant funding will be used to pay for platform development costs only and will be directly re-distributed to the teams and developers who wrote the contracts / front end. MetaFactory is a new type of physical goods auction platform with a focus on apparel, empowering artists to expand their audience and reach through fashion. We curate and manage our product marketplace, cultivate community engagement and handle all product production & fulfillment on behalf of our design partners, so they only need to focus on their art.  The auction platform includes some exciting game mechanics and enables supporters to be directly rewarded through a pro rata refund.  MetaFactory believes it can cultivate more successful brands through higher-engaged communities able to directly participate in the brand’s success. We are making a long term bet on the growth of virtual worlds. We believe that Ethereum, NFTs and the underlying economic foundation will enable success where previous attempts fell short (second life, etc.) The coinciding growth in VR will only further strengthen and support this growth by enabling new immersive experiences where users will desire to personalize their individual experience and appearance. We are looking to validate the potential demand for custom, limited run digi-physical apparel.  Long term, we believe that the digital apparel brands will see significant growth and see physical apparel compliments as a great way to capture attention, add value and attract new audiences.

107,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/dao-proposal-kipa-is-an-extension-for-minting-and-selling-nfts/444,DAO Proposal: KIPA is an extension for minting and selling NFTs - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,007mike," I came to MetaCartel to meet people, work together, impact the community start a project that could take some funds from the DAO and add to blockchain community as a whole. Introducing  KIPA KIPA  is a NFTs bowser extension that’s focused on helping non-crypto users mint and sell their collectibles and tokens. We’re mainly a team of 2 people. I am a Front-end/Web developer, and Brian Nguyen is a Solidity dev. What problem is KIPA going to solve. Exchanges like Opensea, Emoon, Rarebits etc only list collectibles submitted by crypto users unknowingly leaving behind the non-crypto digital artists. A typical blockchain or cypto user understands that selling any NFT maybe as a professional digital artist or not will require an exchange like Opensea, Rarebits etc but a non-crypto person who doesn’t understand what NFTs are will rather stay in the shadow of the centralized art communities, puts it up for sale, then waits for a buyer until he/she can make a dime off their work. KIPA browser extension is going to serve as a connector between the under-served centralized art communities and NFTs community and also bridge the gap so the under-served communities benefit from the freedom the decentralized sector is enjoying. Our ultimate goal is to lower the barrier to adoption and enable non-crypto and crypto users to create their own blockchain assets to use however they wish. Tokens created through the KIPA Extension are powered by smart contracts that enable the minting and selling features. Game developers can utilize smart contracts to create bound tokens, peer-to-peer transaction fees, whitelisted marketplaces, and consumable tokens. Tokens created using this service will be fully supported by any web 3.0 wallets. Why KIPA is different and how does it advance UX and usability Platforms like Mintbase,  Enjin’s Mintshop, Mintportal, Moken etc can all mint token but the user has to visit the site to be able to do so. It’s different with KIPA.  As long as the users is using a browser, he/she can mint ERC - 721 and ERC - 1155 tokens instantly through the KIPA browser extension without leaving their favourite site like Dribbble, Pixiv, Artstation, Behance etc. The minted NFTs or collectibles can be listed on exchanges like Opensea, Emoon etc. Creative Artists? Why this problem? Game and Art market contributes to a very large percent of the world economy. If the crypto and blockchain space could tap into just one-fifth of this market, then it could add around £1 billion to the market valuation and this can only be achieved if there are more platforms and not just few. Digital artists are forced to bend to annual or monthly subscriptions that comes with no guarantee of sales, privacy or safety of their personal data is not certain and this platforms are 100% centralized. If in the decentralized world, NFTs users who are not professional digital artists sell all kinds of NFTs on exchanges everyday and earn some good money for themselves by just listing excluding the crazy monthly fee or submitting their personal data then the professionals who are far more vast in digital arts should be able to make even more money for themselves every single day. Some of the examples of non-fungible tokens are listed but they all are from the virtual world #1. Decentraland is an open source gaming platform that represents a virtual world where you can have virtual pieces of land and other collectibles. #2. Cryptofighters is a game which allows you to collect, battle and level up your fighters to win new fighters. #3. Etherbots is a game where you can put together a robot from various (NFT) parts and have them fight against each other. #4. Ethermon is like pokemon on the blockchain. #5. Rare peppes one of the earliest crypto collectible implementations based on Counterparty. #6. Spells of Genesis, a digital card game with some elements of trade-ability of cards enabled through Counterparty. The product metrics : Places where the extension can be used/Integrated includes major browsers including Chrome. Firefox, Opera, UC Web etc. Any NFTs that is minted on through the KIPA extension will pay a gas fee. Minted NFTs can be listed or traded on any other NFT exchanges like OpenSea , Emoon, Rarebits etc. Asking for 4000 DAI. Funds will be used for building this extension and the transaction fee we get will be used to maintain the platform. Thanks to all of you. Would love feedback.","[(<p>We had a chat about just focusing on: Helping non-crypto artists mint and sell NFTs</p>, 'pet3rpan'), (<p>Is this a secondary marketplace/extension to list/tip on NFTs bought from other marketplaces or also a primary marketplace.

All premium pricing is dynamic based on direct collateralization and uncollateralized exposure of that entity relative to reinsurance pool balance (+ a diversification calculation input) What is needed to get it live is a group of interested people and projects to get the ball rolling.  The last major component we have is “who will approve/deny claims?”.  I think the easiest way to launch would be with a semi-trusted (by application owners and users) group of claims adjusters.  We also need at least 15 or so entities up and running to see useful diversification of risk (necessary for reasonable premiums & good returns for capital providers).  Ideally the claims adjusters know what they are talking about (which isnt guaranteed with platforms like aragon court).  Metacartel has devs and other knowledgeable people in the space and the breadth of products in the ecosystem made me think it could be a great candidate for deployment and launch. The product is structured to self-scale, there are no exposure limits, but as risk centralizes premiums go up.  It is very possible to start small as long as there is a decent number of entities and they can grow and scale together.

From MetaCartel interest to Ryan Zurrer’s DAO to the launch of the LAO to Moloch DAO discussing for profit opportunities, the notion of a distributed profit mechanism is  Less talked about, however, is the market of opportunities and dApps who would be classified as attractive candidates for investment. How do we incubate the dApps of today for the investment opportunities of tomorrow? And, how do we surface less popular projects that are equally attractive opportunities? DApp Portal Sites like Product Hunt and Angellist have been successful at bringing obscure projects into the mainstream-- through a social, searchable, and public forum. The Web3 world requires a similar central hub for surfacing top dApps. Not only does this aid in discoverability (i.e -wow this dapp exists), it also aids in investability (i.e wow this dapp is cool AND has revenue potential) To demonstrate investability, dApp projects need to surface metrics investors care about. Not just users, transaction volume, etc-- but useful user behavior metrics (retention, engagement) and cold hard REVENUE. For dApps, a potential community-driven portal serves as an interface where they can customize and publish metrics dashboards. The portal does the heavy lifting on data collection and data visualization, enabling a drag and drop experience for dApps. All dashboards are public and searchable. Simultaneously, it serves as a way for investors and community members to search for projects. And, in the future, facilitate investment in the projects. Another DAO When the time comes for profit seeking entities to evaluate the investment potential of dApps, they will turn to the DApp portal to view stats on a project. The portal itself may be funded by a DAO (DAppDAO? RevenueDAO?). The DAO earns revenue by taking a claim on the revenue of dApp projects who use the portal. The value proposition is that the portal is surfacing project metrics, garnering investment interest, and facilitating the investment itself (via potential appDAOs in the future - @OKDuncan) For profit DAOs would potentially invest in the DAO and earn a share of the revenue. In this way, a symbiotic relationship forms between investors, THE portal, and dApps. The portal serves as an information conduit between the two. Goal The goal is to establish the portal as THE place to go for project metrics and, in the future, investment. And, wait for it, GENERATE REVENUE. A top goal of the portal is to accelerate revenue generating activities in dApps, investment in dApps, and increase the loop over and over and over Let’s Jam on It This idea has progressed from conversations with a variety of MetaCartel members and was borne out of necessity-- as a product we know needs to be built in some capacity. The product will inevitably evolve over time. Let’s chat about it, what it might look like in the future, how we get this thing built, and how we accelerate revenue-generating dApps.",[],2019-09-10T17:50:25Z

The first version, including a live demo, is available at: https://solui.dev Unlike other similar tools, it is also intended for testing locally-developed contracts. Developers write a JSON template and check it into source control alongside their contracts. Once it’s ready they can publish it straight to IPFS so that it’s always available. Everything is handled through the command-line client, installed via: The roadmap going forward involves, amongst others: I hope solUI can - if the community likes it - evolve into a commonly-used tool such that in future the majority of on-chain contracts get deployed along with user-friendly UIs. It would be cool to be able to enter just a contract address (no ABI needed) into something like Etherscan and immediately get a nice UI for the contract. At present the team is just me (@hiddentao).

Signal DAO allows for communities to spin up a smart contract voting system that can be accessed via mobile through Telegram. Eventually, the project will be templatized so anyone can choose and modify the copy to fit their needs. To test the hypothesis, we’d like to build a telegram Signal DAO bot for the MetaCartel and Moloch communities. The goal being 1. to attract and add members interested in submitting fundable ideas and allow for the communities to identify which ideas have the most promise via voting and 2. test a new way for DAO interactions to provide for a path of greater engagement and reduce information asymmetry. This information gathered can help inform the community about investment opportunities, valuable experiments, and ideate about more tools to enhance coordination moving forward. The Signal DAO will be made and managed in telegram. It is invite-only, but anyone who knows one person in the DAO can join. We are looking for a small grant to develop the bot and run experiments moving forward. Parameters:
Network: Kovan
Voting Period: 30 mins

Amount requested US$2k We will be apply for funding from 3 groups: Aragon, DAOStack and Metacartel. If we get approved from at least 2 then we will proceed. If only approved by one group then the proposal won’t go ahead and funds will be returned to that group. The key objective is to grow the community by: As MetaCartel is a relative new comer to this space, but gathering momentum, I believe important that more people are aware of it (and the differences from the more established platforms like DAOStack/Aragon/Colony). The first course is now confirmed at Victoria University, Wellington, New Zealand and will begin in 11th November 2019. We are in discussion with Auckland University and will approach other Universities in Australia. Note that currently it wouldn’t be offered online / distance learning, one of our objectives is to encourage localised communities to flourish. The course would be a 6 week module consisting of 30 hrs of “face to face” lectures/tutorials/workshops and 200 hours of student time. We are hoping that the group will build relationships and work together / support each other after the course. This course is designed for non technical people as an introduction to the Blockchain and Decentralised Autonomous Organisations.  It will include some hands-on programming (but no prior programming experience needed) and hands-on creating a real-life DAO’s on the Aragon, DAOStack and MetaCartel platforms.

It was a pleasure hanging out with some of you all in Denver. After discussions with @pet3rpan @OKDuncan @JamesW and a few others, I have a unique proposal for DAO membership and a test project for the rev gen DAO that we decided should be posted here (although it crosses over a few topics). Will follow the structure as much as I can, but this taps into a few things that may warrant further discussion from the DAO before it can be accepted. I started the first-ever token launch consulting company called Cryptodex and got to work on some really cool projects including SingularDTV (now Breaker), Tokencard (now Monolith), Primalbase and Bancor. I have been designing unique revenue-generating models for DAOs and community-based economies since I left my time with Bancor which I am happy to have a discussion with anyone here about. @Dekan or @vengist can confirm this. I want to join the DAO because I am a huge fan of what you all are up to and can contribute to designing the model for the rev-gen DAO. I also have a project that I think will be a perfect prototype project for the rev-gen DAO to work on, (that we can start using now) which I will get into more in the next question. I also want to go fast and far simultaneously and as we all know, teamwork makes the dream work. This is the unique part of my application, so I apologize in advance for the length of the post. I have been working on a project called Mediate that is a building block for many other applications. The great thing is that it can stand as an application by itself and has multiple use cases with revenue-generating possibilities. The alpha of the application is live on Rinkeby and can be tested here. It is essentially an application for bets and escrows on Ethereum. Here are some of the possible use cases with explanations. Here is a short-form version of use cases: Buy/sell online social media accounts Escrow for an item on craigslist Replace eBay like services Freelance services Buy/sell In-game items Twitter betting As you can see from the link to the app above, the application is basically complete, and minor UI/UX tweaks can make it more suitable for different use cases. We should focus on one primary use case to start - I would suggest social twitter betting. I do not have the capacity to work on this project alone. I want to contribute in the way that makes sense (product design and biz dev), but need technical and marketing support from a great organization like MetaCartel DAO. What I am proposing is that we create a token where the holders receive the revenue generated from each escrow or bet created. I would allocate MetaCartel 60% of the profits generated in perpetuity as my tribute to join the DAO (or another way of looking at this is giving 60% of the equity in Mediate to the DAO). There is a developer that I have been working with on the project who is an amazing Solidity developer based in Columbia whom I would also like to receive DAO membership for this proposal. With the current ETH price around $180, the value of two 10 ETH memberships is $3,600. Trading 60% of an almost complete dapp with rev-gen potential seems to me to be a fair value. If Felipe, the solidity developer mentioned above and one front end developer work on the project we could start releasing various use cases for this project quickly and solidify a building block for many future applications. Additionally, as mentioned above, this would be a great prototype for a rev-gen project that we can start working on today and have a functional project for the rev-gen DAO immediately upon launch. I have been in crypto since 2011 and have a passion for economics I have been working on local currency models for communities for the past couple of years on my project Native. We released an alpha towards the end of last year and have a super exciting partnership in the Denver area and are building a fully integrated community application with a physical space I look forward to seeing how this proposal is received by the MetaCartel and am excited to work with you all to create the rev-gen DAO.",[],2019-10-29T18:27:08Z

Over the past few months, I’ve worked to build a stable, modular framework for building Burner Wallets, called the Burner Wallet 2. This project has gained substantial community support and powered experiences at ETHBoston, ETHBerlin and Devcon (with a fresh new design). One major feature of the Burner Wallet 2 is a robust interface for integrating plugins into the wallet. This allows developers to easily experiment with potential Burner Wallet ideas, without having to build an entire application. A number of plugins have already been built for the Burner Wallet, such as the Ching plugin which adds support for the Ching POS system. For more information about the Burner Wallet 2, check out this recent blog post, or take a look at the code. On November 8th, the second ETHWaterloo hackathon will kick off. Similar to ETHDenver, all attendees of ETHWaterloo will be given paper wallets and will use a Burner Wallet for purchasing food and drinks. Austin Griffith is providing assistance on creating a fun “stock market” experience for buying drinks at the after party. In addition to powering the ETHWaterloo, I’m hoping to encourage hackers to use the Burner Wallet 2 as a framework for building their submissions.

If an application such as Pool Together wanted to run a marketing campaign for their app. They can do so by using a LinkDrop campaign to drive traffic to their mobile mini dapp in Alice. The reason you would build a mobile mini dapp is because 1 - it’s easy and 2 - that’s where most users are, in mobile. Then from driving traffic to it’s mini dapp, Pool Together can run an ad campaign in their UI to be able to get extra revenue through web3 ads. An organization (DAOSaka, Known Origin) is paying the user extra DAI for this ad space and they can then benefit in turn from a traffic being driven to their dapp. The proposal is for $5k USD to build a fully operational MVP of a Pool Together Mini Dapp, LinkDrop campaign, and Ads Network ad pop up markpereira.eth  ==  0xA1b02d8c67b0FDCF4E379855868DeB470E169cfB","[(<p>Notes from Ven and Drew for the DAO</p>, 'vengist')]",2019-09-22T16:46:43Z

Asset prices are set by the oracle. Anyone can deposit funds into the contract to earn trading fees. More information here http://docs.stablecoinswap.io/ and here https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/cuo33b/introducing_stablecoinswap_a_dapp_which_allows/ Problem 1 - high slippage for anything but small amounts Swapping even moderate amounts of stablecoins on decentralized exchanges currently bears a high slippage. For example, uniswap spread on TUSD-USDC for 10,000 TUSD is 16.8% due to a large slippage. Problem 2 - many trading pairs are not available on decentralized exchanges Some trading pairs are only available on centralized exchanges. Solution Stablecoinswap contract acts as an on-chain reserve which allows anyone to swap between any supported stablecoins. Prices are set by the oracle which means as long as the contract has enough liquidity, your order will be executed with zero slippage. No matter if the order is just $100 or $100,000. Progress and roadmap The project is live on the mainnet and the contract is open-sourced and verified on Etherscan - see our docs (I can’t post more than 2 links here).

132,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/12-pending-dao-funding-proposal-sustainus/165,#12 [🔄 pending] DAO Funding Proposal: Sustainus - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,lastmjs," Sustainus is currently in alpha: https://sustainus.io/ The open source ecosystem has always faced problems of sustainability. The Ethereum community is largely built on top of open source software and faces the same sustainability issues as the open source community at large. Sustainus is an npm package that allows software developers to setup one recurring donation that is automatically split evenly amongst their software dependencies. Sustainus is installed traditionally: npm install -g sustainus On install, Sustainus scans the developer’s machine for node_modules directories, and finds the Ethereum address or name located in the ethereum property of the package.json file of each dependency. Sustainus comes with a client app (most likely will be an Electron app) that allows the user to setup a local wallet and insert funds. The client will show all verified dependencies (dependencies with a well-formatted Ethereum address or name), and will allow the developer to set an amount and interval for payout. Once setup and as long as the wallet maintains enough funds for payouts, Sustainus operates in the background indefinitely, continuously supporting the open source ecosystem automatically. One of the main advantages to this model is the reduction to zero of marginal cognitive friction for donating to each dependency. The software developer does not need to sign up individually for each dependency, considering pros and cons and amounts and payment systems. One donation is setup automatically, and Sustainus takes care of the rest. The Ethereum blockchain and the open source ecosystem are already setup to mesh nicely. npm and its package.json system will make integrating Ethereum payments simple and permissionless. I imagine/hope that Ethereum developers would be the first to enthusiastically adopt. Imagine if each Ethereum developer voluntarily chose to give just $5 per month back to the ecosystem. One more thing, for simplicity the heuristic for determining payout is to just split up the donation evenly among dependencies. After initial traction and proving of the idea, more complicated and fair heuristics could be experimented with. @pet3rpan","[(<p>This is really dope… I imagine you’ve spoken with the OSCoin crew?</p>, 'OKDuncan'), (<p>also suggest putting up a grant account on gitcoin!</p>, 'OKDuncan')]",2019-08-22T16:47:43Z

There is no business model, and no token to buy. rDAI is for the ethereum community to use, build, and create. Read more about it: Ultimately, this is an on-chain primitive that allows developers to program logic around the interest accrued by a user’s staked DAI. Users are used to locking up funds in dApps, so any interest generated like this is effectively ‘free money’. Developers can now build interest based business models where the underlying collateral never needs to leave user’s control. eg. Buying access via interest.

This proposal outlines a grant of $2,500 USD to provide liquidity to the TCR’s bonding curve. Unique experimental value proposition: It is really hard to find things in the Ethereum ecosystem. It is extremely difficult to discover, become aware and to search for valuable information around Ethereum community projects, people and resources. This need has been signaled internally within the MetaCartel DAO and by the EF.

Other DAOs then wanted to fork the frontend and use for their DAO (YangDAO, TrojanDAO, OrochiDAO, etc). Rahul of Moloch also expressed interest in sharing updates. So we backed up and setup an open-source, bare-bones repo of the frontend so that we could iterate on the global functionality and the forks could pull our updates as desired. This repo is pocket-moloch => https://github.com/odyssy-automaton/pocket-moloch Pokémol is now a shared product spawned by MetaCartel and Moloch DAOs, and this proposal is a start on how we can decentralize product improvement. What are we building? Due to the extended usage already happening, we’re seeing the beginnings of some interesting product-market. Now Pokémol serves a wider audience of DAOs, and is deserving of its own product focus. By focusing our attention on a parent Pokémol product, we the DAOs can better collaborate and iterate in one place and send updates throughout what has become a Moloch ecosystem (The House of Moloch). Who are we building it for? Anyone who wants to launch a user-friendly, mobile-first Moloch DAO for their community/org/group. Why is this exciting? Optimizes process for any group of humans to fork Moloch and have a mobile DAO up within a week, that can receive ongoing updates from parent Pokémol. With each new DAO fork, and subsequent DApp, comes a new interestingly diverse group of users that we can all learn from. Due to the improved usability of the contract wallet flow (which will be greatly improved even through these efforts), many of these users will be n00bz and thus offer the crown jewel of usability testing for our ecosystem. Combined with DAOHaus (newly built at ETHBerlin), humans will be able to Summon their own Moloch, accept Pledges, and deploy a Pokémol frontend. Collectively, we’re looking to shorten the level-of-effort from summon to live-voting as much as possible. Though Pokémol is open-source, there is a path to monetization through customization. A product roadmap could look like the following: Now: Iterate on the pocket-moloch repo to get to v1.0 and push to current forks Future: Build a frontend to launch infinite Moloch forks with user-defined configurations: DAOHaus does this now (Built at EthBerlin). Integrate with DAOHaus for one-click Dapp deployment. Future Future: Utilize lessons learned from diverse DAO use cases – v0.6 UX-UI improvements throughout Social Recovery Boring but crucial bug-fixes – v0.7 Wallet – v0.8 Signal to Join 3Box integrations Member Voting History – v0.9 Optimized DevOps Advanced DAO Metric Visualizations – v1.0 Native App Versioning Push Notifications and User Preferences – v1.0+ Decentralized devOps (R&D required) Admin Interface Support Efforts Ongoing maintenance of Pokémol and support to new and existing Molochs Open Source This is currently an ongoing open-source effort. We would like to ensure the implementation receives a top notch effort and in a timely manner. There is some current dialog with Moloch and MetaCartel dev teams, but we would like to explore a more synergistic collaboration to see how much we can share and consolidate improvement efforts to ensure max potential is reached asap (minimum capital deployment for maximum impact).

140,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/5-declined-dao-proposal-automatic-fair-peer-to-peer-podcast-donations-with-podcrypt/76,"#5 [💔 declined] DAO proposal: Automatic, fair, peer-to-peer podcast donations with Podcrypt - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum",lastmjs," Podcrypt, https://podcrypt.app, is a podcast application that allows listeners to setup one recurring donation that is automatically split amongst verified podcasts based on time listened. For example, as a listener you might want to donate $10 per month to your favorite podcasts. So, you fund your Podrypt wallet with some ETH, set the donation amount to $10, and set the interval to 30 days: 
Screenshot_20190723-174919.png1080×1920 120 KB
 Then you go about your life and enjoy all of those tasty podcasts. At the end of the interval, Podcrypt will automatically distribute ETH to the verified podcasts that you have listened to, in proportion to the time that you’ve spent listening. Repeat at will. Podcasts and their creators provide an enormous service to their listeners. I have personally benefited immensely from the many many hours of podcasts that I have listened to over the years, from travel to business to software engineering. Unfortunately, the value given out is harder to return. Podcasts are generally free. The podcasting ecosystem is very open and decentralized. This is wonderful, but brings with it some unique challenges. It seems that in any open, decentralized, generally free-of-charge ecosystem, there is a monetary sustainability problem. Open source software is a good example of this. To overcome these limitations, creators must often rely on a third-party source of funds. In open source software, this third-party is usually a business that subsidizes the development and maintenance of the code. For podcasts, it’s advertisers. Because podcasters have to go to a third-party to receive value in return for the value they create, the market is inherently inefficient. Podcasters have to spend resources obtaining sponsorships and airing adds, instead of focusing on the core value that they are trying to provide. It would be much better to capture value directly from listeners. But, that could destroy the open and decentralized nature of podcasting, which I believe would be a tragedy. Donations are an obvious solution to sustainability that maintains openness and fairness. Indeed, companies like Patreon and Twitch are showing that this can be very effective. Podrypt proposes a donation model that is automatic, fair, and peer-to-peer. Users do not have to sign up to become donors of each podcast individually, but they subscribe to the entire domain of podcasts and Podcrypt takes care of the rest. I believe this unique value proposition will help podcast donations go mainstream, as it removes much of the friction of other platforms. Podcrypt is for podcast creators and listeners. Creators do not have to interact much with Pocdrypt if they don’t want to. All they have to do to “signup” is add an Ethereum address into their podcast description. They can then handle their donations in whatever manner they please. Podcast listeners will be the main active users of the application. I am currently focusing on a very narrow total addressable market (TAM). Currently that is avid podcast listeners who are willing to donate and who are Ethereum enthusiasts and early tech adopters. Over time I will continue to expand the TAM to broaden it as much as possible. For example, adding stablecoins like DAI, USDC, or Libra and allowing credit card purchases directly within the app will begin to broaden the TAM from Ethereum enthusiasts to average people who transact online. As Podcrypt progresses from alpha to beta to full release, the early adopter requirement should get dropped. I will work to drop other requirements as far as possible. Podcrypt is experimenting with an entirely new use case for cryptocurrency. As far as I know there is no other podcast application remotely similar. Essentially, Podcrypt is doing something very similar to Brave with its attention-based ecosystem, but Podcrypt is a podcast browser and not a general web browser. As for UX, Podcrypt is attempting to onboard as many avid podcast listeners as possible. This will only be achieved by removing friction everywhere possible. Podcrypt is doing this in a few ways: In my opinion Podcrypt is a great example of a practical every-day cryptocurrency/blockchain application. It provides a real-world applied consumer financial use-case. I think it has the opportunity to do great things for podcasting sustainability, and to onboard many more people into crypto. Also, because of the growing popularity of podcasting, and the crypto community’s seemingly inherent interest in sharing information through podcasts, perhaps Podcrypt can become one of the most widely used Ethereum apps. There are currently ~20 verified podcasts on Podcrypt. I am requesting $8000 in funding. My goal is to provide myself at least a 1 year runway that allows me to go full-time on Podcrypt. The funds would help me reach that goal, and would also provide capital for subsidizing metatransactions, travel for conferences, etc. I also have a co-founder who would receive some of the funds. I currently work on Podcrypt part-time, and so far I have been able to do initial validation (talking to a few hundred people, getting an initial Telegram group membership of 100 members), build and release the pre-alpha on a test network and then the alpha on Ethereum. I hope to have the beta out by the end of July. Having a runway of 1 year would allow me to get to a 1.0 release, or if already there continue to refine Podcrypt and move to a 2.0 release. I also feel it will be necessary to do a lot of outreach to create partnerships and begin to expand outside of the crypto community. Also, in case it isn’t apparent, Podcrypt is a for-profit business. I will also be working on product-market fit and business models and trying to reach sustainability/profitability.","[(<p>Apologies <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/lastmjs"">@lastmjs</a>, I completely missed this.

Maskbook and several underlying technology. It’s a layer upon any internet(web2.0) giant and help users preserve privacy, own their data/asset, and join the web3.0 world seamlessly. Who are you building for? General public who are aware of the problem of internet (web2.0) today (privacy, censorship, and etc) but have no other place to run – other platforms are either too geeky or still centralized. We would like to create a bridge for general public to migrate to web3.0 without changing their way of using internet. Using maskbook, you can encrypt you post, send crypto/digital asset to your friend on platforms like facebook (no need for Libra.) How does it advance UX, usability or experiment with a new use case? UX: all social networks & web 2.0 giants are our UX!
Usability: It’s super easy to use. You can still post/comment/whatever but it will be natively integrated with Web3/blockchain. It’s chain agnostic to users. New Use Case: We’re open sourced Maskbook Source Code and ready to discover new use case with our community/supporter. We believe our users and other developers will experiment more fancy new use case – such as trade the key to decrypt a post as NFT, etc. Why is this exciting? This is probably one of the most efficient way to expand the web3.0 and DAO to real people outside our small crypto community.

I’ll have a couple QR codes for the customer to scan at the stand that will deep link them to the Coinbase Wallet or Trust Wallet dapp browser. This will open up a secret page for them on Mintbase. If the customer has the ticket on their laptop with MetaMask or anything else they will have to open this page manually (The link will be short). The loading of this page will have a few visuals checking that they are the owner and the ticket hasn’t been spent yet. Behind the scenes it will disable the ticket on a central server to prevent double spend (not perfect, but gets the job done and no gas required).

143,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/10-declined-dao-proposal-social-layer-dapp-for-metacartel/141,#10 [💔 declined] DAO Proposal: Social Layer dApp for MetaCartel - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,rafaelcalcada," Hello MetaCartel! In the last couple of years, I´ve been working with Plurall to better understand communication platforms and coordination mechanisms. As doing that, we ended up joining the crypto world and lots of the concepts we were exploring are still here today. So here is how we imagine we could collaborate: Fund Plurall team to create a dApp version of Askker.io, a mobile-first social network and use it to become the social layer of communication for the Cartel. The idea behind Plurall is to create a DAO to govern communication platforms. While we work on the DAO side(Hi, Berlin!), we shipped votter.io and askker.io and been exploring and evolving those products so they make sense for communities. Both the crypto space, small green communities, and the digital social innovation hubs. Both seem to have similar goals and values, but still really disconnected in terms of UX, communication, onboarding. Most of the human traffic on the internet today is mobile and routed through some form of a social network. The crypto space still doesn’t have a standard. Twitter is centralized/banning people, FB is FB, Mastodon is not web3, etc. That would be one of the first experiments in bringing a replicable model of a social network to the web3 and also with the advantage of being able to adjust it to more specific MetaCartel goas/desire. Everybody wants to be the next Google/Facebook/Instagram. No one wants to share its governance. We believe that dApps change the way that it can be done and creating the correct system to empower autonomous organizations can create radical and systemic change in the flow of information of society. Changing what we consume, how we think and how we coordinate. We have a stable version running since last year. Here are some screenshots with some of the working features(groups, hashtags, voting, etc)

 Currently a centralized platform, we want it to be a white-label software for building the social layer. That way, people will start having access to p2p communication and group coordination without always relying on trusted-third-parties(censors, etc). While this is an exploration topic, the idea if the reception is good is to better scope the features and changes necessary and request for a grant. We would also like to better connect with anyone working in related areas or that has some ideas on how to evolve those concepts. Happy to receive feedback and discuss further details at rafael@blinq-solutions.com, here in the forum or in Berlin during the Blockchain Week and MetaCartel demo day.

While this is convenient it doesn’t give you much decision power when it comes to the roadmap of the product and most important the rules of use.</p>, 'pet3rpan'), (<p>not sure about how long it will take until something controversial becomes a reason for ban on those platforms, but in our previous research both the makers community and crypto community had high preference for censorship resistant alternatives and people would go a great length to both have privacy and control of their spaces.

Zero fees. Zero barriers - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,Bryan-Cryptoraves," What are you building? We are building a tokenization experience for Twitter users.  It’s a barrier-free way to test-drive crypto.  They can launch and transfer tokens directly on Twitter by simply Tweeting. Who are you building for? We’re building for crypto enthusiasts and the crypto-curious.  We will also look to partner with other projects,  and showcase their tokens in the same way through our platform.  The model allows for any ERC20/721 token native to Layer 1 to be transported into our Layer 2 Dapp (Including stablecoins). How does it advance UX, usability or experiment with a new use case? The UX IS Twitter, an already familiar interface to a large audience.  Maximum usability means no fees, no metamask, only Tweeting. The Cryptoraves use case is to capture the intrinsic value of social media through tokenization.  We can do this by giving the user a personal, measurable, portable unit whose value they can grow and control. But also, because the token is personalized, we believe our users will create their own innovative and interesting use cases, based on their own unique needs and motivations.  They can demonstrate their use cases and the benefits of tokenization directly on a familiar social media platform where they are already established. Why is this exciting? This is a completely risk-free, and yet authentic way for a user to express appreciation. It allows for a more genuine signal than the generic and scarcity-free “like/heart/upvote” of web 2.0.  Also, via blockchain technology we can observe the network effect of each users’ token interactions. And from that define a metric that ranks that users’ network. We believe that individuals who are able to run their own token economy will deepen their understanding of tokenization benefits.   It will give users working knowledge and practical, hands-on experience with the technology.   They will feel empowered as their perspective begins to shift. The “A-HA” moment. How much funding do you need and what will it be used to do? We are requesting $5000 to outsource a new website that will better service the users.

147,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/4-declined-dao-proposal-solidified-audit-marketplace/75,#4 [💔 declined] DAO proposal: Solidified Audit Marketplace - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,fabiohild," Solidified is a community based smart contract security project, helping Ethereum users gain wide access to the proper security tools and competent audit experts for a reasonable price. We have built a bug bounty platform  (web.solidified.io) that has been used by Gnosis, Melonport, Polymath, Kleros and other major clients. On this platform users can post their smart contracts for review with a large community of security auditors (we have gathered over 200 pre-vetted experts since 2017). The platform is specific to smart contract peer-review and itself runs on Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to fund their bounties (setting the values for each bug severity), respond to bug reports, get notifications about progress and also has a simple arbitration built-in. The platform has been running on Rinkeby for several months and we are actively working to move it to the mainnet (just performed a 2nd audit of the platform). We also have been running community audits since 2017 where a group of three community members are selected (based on their background experience and relevance to the project) and a peer-review audit process is performed, with a consensus report produced. All audit reports are publicly available here: https://github.com/solidified-platform/audits.
Clients include: Argent, Bankera, Gnosis, Melonport, Nexus Mutual, Polymath, Wyvern and 60 others. We are seeking a grant of 25,000 USD to fund the development of an audit marketplace that will replace our manual process of running community audits and utilize our already created bug bounty platform for the UI/UX and backend blockchain operations. Our vision for this product is an automatic unstoppable marketplace for both security professionals and clients, where Ethereum developers or enthusiasts can post their smart contracts for review with reputable security experts. We expect that this marketplace will lower the barrier of entry for aspiring security professionals and also the cost of security engagements for the whole community. We will then become simply a participant in this market, like any other security specialist. We plan on integrating one of the open-source tools like Mythril or Slither into the first-stage of our  audit marketplace, to automatically find low-hanging bugs before the audit begins. We believe that while tools cannot alone be relied upon in an audit, they serve as a useful pre-check to help auditors concentrate on the non-trivial issues. By combining the human audits with bug bounties and further empowering them with automated verification tools, we are creating a multi-stage approach to auditing that is much more effective at catching bugs than the current methods. All stakeholders should benefit from this dapp. Developers and companies building on top of Ethereum can use it to seek for specialist advice for fair market set prices. Security specialists will have a source of work. The wider security community can benefit from information and bugs to improve their skills and discuss new found vulnerabilities. The wider Ethereum community benefits from safer smart contracts, and a place to check if the dapp they intend to use was scrutinized and tested by competent auditors. The grant will be used to cover the engineering costs of developing the audit marketplace. We already have the best talent working together on this platform (one of the winners of Solidity underhanded contest and several top security auditors in the space). We’ve been working together as a team for almost two years. The bug bounty platform has been online for over a year now at web.solidified.io, already used by Gnosis, Melonport, Wyvern, Kleros and over 50 other companies. In it anyone can upload their smart contracts and fund bounties, the code is made available to the whole community, and bounties are automatically paid. Although the bug bounty platform is in beta, the bug bounties listed there are real, and we are currently coordinating mainnet ETH payments after the the automated payments are made in the Rinkeby testnet ETH. We are on the final stages of developing the mainnet version of the smart contracts, that will work in a fully permissionless and decentralized manner, requiring no signup/login or identity. The frontend is being reduced to become a presentation layer, while also supporting some functions not feasible to be made on chain right now (such as storing source code files). We will reuse the design and components of the bug bounty platform for the marketplace and by doing so we expect to reduce the amount of work needed. We have also been performing the manual audit process in ways we think will fit well within a decentralized context. For each audit, three experts are selected, quote their prices and work independently. In the group debrief meeting, all reports are then opened and consensus-merged into a final audit report. By requiring the auditors to work independently we create a healthy competition that pushes each expert to deliver their best work while keeping the process unbiased. We have the high level design of the process already done. Once a request for audit is posted in the marketplace (along with the value the client is willing to pay and specification, we will assist him into setting an effective price by using the smart contract complexity analyser already developed for the bug bounty platform). Experts will bid their way into the audit. The client will then select the auditors based on price, in-system reputation and also previous work (we will allow companies/experts to identify themselves so they can leverage their reputation, while also making it easier for clients to make a decision). Security auditors will receive the fees from the client upon delivery of the report. Their bids and corresponding stakes are locked in through the duration of the audit, and will be used later on to fund a bug bounty right after the audit ends, for a predefined period of time. This bug bounty will leverage the community to verify the audit quality, and should work well for new entrants in the market to gather reputation that enables them to apply for audits. We believe that by doing it this way we incentivise the experts to perform their best work, while at the same time holding them accountable for work performed poorly. Once the bug bounty is over, auditors’ stakes are returned (proportionally if bugs were found/payed out). The process will remain available publicly for security professionals to study issues/bugs, and for users to check if the dapp has been sufficiently scrutinized.","[(<p>Hey <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/fabiohild"">@fabiohild</a> thanks for your proposal and for writing this up.</p>, 'pet3rpan'), (<p>Hello <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/pet3rpan"">@pet3rpan</a>, thanks for the feedback.</p>, 'fabiohild'), (<p>We had a brief discussion in our last DAO members meeting and did not find that Solidified would be in the scope of this DAO.

149,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/0-declined-dao-proposal-invest-on-the-dao-code/18,#0 [💔 declined] DAO proposal: invest on the DAO code - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,AvsA," As you’re all probably very aware, @pet3rpan has forked Moloch and convinced a bunch of us to create a Metacartel DAO. It now has about less than 20 members and about $200-250k  on it. Peter can give the exact amounts. While it’s a great achievement it’s by no means a fortune and we have a limited window of attention to turn it into something great. Compared to other projects, it starts short on cash and short on time, but it is still abundant in it’s ability to cause impact. That is why I propose that the first round of funding should go on the DAO itself, to increase it, build on the basic Moloch game theory and conquer it’s own personality. Here are the main changes I believe should be worked on: Every proposal would have 3 main asks: a (smaller) amount of upfront tokens, a rate in which new tokens are paid over time and a deadline at which that rate ends. The amount of tokens anyone has at any given point, for all practical purposes (ragequit, voting, etc) are always set at (amount of tokens in balance) + (rate of new tokens) * ( ( current time or the end of contract, whichever is smaller) - (last date in which the rate was changed)). While tokens that were given cannot be taken away, the rate of new tokens can be changed at any time, via the normal proposal mechanism. It creates the following incentives: Grantees are “contracted” and paid continuously over time, but they can be “fired” at any moment (with the proper notice being the usual time delays required for voting a proposal), creating a better incentive for responsible, long term and mutually benefitial relationships between grantees and the DAO. All relationships have a deadline so the default action if noone is taken is to end any relationship (grantee or member) that doesn’t bother to justify it’s own value Inactive Members are diluted away. In the beginning, all members getting 100 shares or 1 share per day is identical for all voting matters. But over time, as new shares are continuously given and some members are dropped off, then the old shares of inactive members are dilluted in their power, therefore guaranteeing that the most active voting power remains to current members, not only founders who have long gone It’s more in line with current experiments that are gathering attention, like Vitalik’s DAICO, or Andrew Yang’s push for Basic Income and therefore is more likely to capture the public’s mind and be more aligned with future use cases It’s very easy to implement. Really, it’s a few extra lines of code, I can do the basic changes myself (but it’s better to add more automated tests) Other possible improvements are… This is specially relevant with the previous point. If the DAO can use the power of a continuously interest paying token like cDAI, then it would make even more sense for it to pay in a continuous aspec. We can even imagine a scenario in the future that the DAO has enough cash to be able to fund projects forever with just the interest Traditionally in schemes like these, only a small amount of the total members are active, but with a few governance experiments we can make sure that votes are still aligned with the overall will of all members. For instance, what if when a proposal is rejected, all the members who voted against it have their shares slashed by 1-5%, while those who successfully predicted the result by voting with it have their shares increased? What if we experiment with liquid delegate voting or other continuous models? Or also go with the continuous voting system and try “conviction voting”. This is an area in which I don’t claim to know the answers but I would love to see more participation Who would the money actually go to? The one and only Austin Griffith, of course! This is where we can kill two stones with a single bird (or something like that): Austin has experience building continuous payments schemes, and has a great track record at making acessible experiments, and he just happens to be available and looking to work in open source community funded experiments. So we pay Austin for a few months of work to build this our current Vanilla Moloch DAO into something unique.","[(<p>Yes! Great suggestions to be implemented into the DAO. However I question how much should we budgeting for improvements on the DAO vs. funding for application projects that advance UX, Usability or new usecases?

150,https://forum.metacartel.org/t/2-funded-dao-proposal-retroactively-fund-odyssy-dao-dapp-work/49,#2 [✅ Funded] DAO Proposal: Retroactively Fund Odyssy DAO DApp Work - 🔥 DAO Proposals - 🤩 MetaCartel Forum,ahoff," PROPOSAL Fund the Odyssy team $3,000 USD retroactively for their work on the DAO front end. PROGRESS The Odyssy team has made significant progress on the DAO dApp. You can see the demo here: https://vimeo.com/346973242
Password: metametameta ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND Previously, onboarding new DAO members was a technical, cumbersome process that required complex contract interaction, wrapping ETH, and more. Additionally, future contract interactions for voting on proposals would have been complex. The app created by the Odyssy team allows DAO members to easily interact with the DAO and vote on proposals from an intuitive front end on any device or browser and on mobile or desktop. It’s the first front end of its kind and sets a usability standard for all DAOs. RETROACTIVE FUNDING The Odyssy team stepped up and offered to build the front end. The DAO should reward their initiative with one grant in the first wave. Retroactive funding has been used at other DAOs, like Moloch DAO, to help fund the necessary initial DAO development.","[(<p>This is really well done. It looks to be mobile first, which will be AMAZING. Congrats team.</p>, 'rzurrer'), (<p>Agree, I would be in favor of funding this.</p>, 'nh2')]",2019-07-15T17:02:40Z
